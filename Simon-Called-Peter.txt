SIMON	CALLED	PETER

BY	ROBERT	KEABLE

AUTHOR	OF	"THE	DRIFT	OF	PINIONS,"	"STANDING	BY,"	ETC.

1921





THIS	BOOK	IS	DEDICATED	TO	JULIE

She	never	lived,	maybe,	but	it	is	truer	to	say	that	she	never	dies.	Nor	shall	she ever	die.	One	may	believe	in	God,	though	He	is	hard	to	find,	and	in	Women, though	such	as	Julie	are	far	to	seek.





THE	AUTHOR	TO	THE	READER

The	glamour	of	no	other	evil	thing	is	stronger	than	the	glamour	of	war.	It	would seem	as	if	the	cup	of	the	world's	sorrow	as	a	result	of	war	had	been	filled	to	the brim	again	and	again,	but	still	a	new	generation	has	always	been	found	to	forget.

A	new	generation	has	always	been	found	to	talk	of	the	heroisms	that	the	divine in	us	can	manifest	in	the	mouth	of	hell	and	to	forget	that	so	great	a	miracle	does not	justify	our	creation	of	the	circumstance.

Yet	if	ever	war	came	near	to	its	final	condemnation	it	was	in	1914-1918.	Our comrades	died	bravely,	and	we	had	been	willing	to	die,	to	put	an	end	to	it	once and	for	all.	Indeed	war-weary	men	heard	the	noise	of	conflict	die	away	on November	11,	1918,	thinking	that	that	end	had	been	attained.	It	is	not	yet	three years	ago;	a	little	time,	but	long	enough	for	betrayal.

Long	enough,	too,	for	the	making	of	many	books	about	it	all,	wherein	has	been recorded	such	heroisms	as	might	make	God	proud	and	such	horror	as	might make	the	Devil	weep.	Yet	has	the	truth	been	told,	after	all?	Has	the	world realized	that	in	a	modern	war	a	nation	but	moves	in	uniform	to	perform	its ordinary	tasks	in	a	new	intoxicating	atmosphere?	Now	and	again	a	small percentage	of	the	whole	is	flung	into	the	pit,	and,	for	them,	where	one	in	ten	was heavy	slaughter,	now	one	in	ten	is	reasonable	escape.	The	rest,	for	the	greater part	of	the	time,	live	an	unnatural	life,	death	near	enough	to	make	them	reckless and	far	enough	to	make	them	gay.	Commonly	men	and	women	more	or	less restrain	themselves	because	of	to-morrow;	but	what	if	there	be	no	to-morrow?

What	if	the	dice	are	heavily	weighted	against	it?	And	what	of	their	already jeoparded	restraint	when	the	crisis	has	thrown	the	conventions	to	the	winds	and there	is	little	to	lighten	the	end	of	the	day?

Thus	to	lift	the	veil	on	life	behind	the	lines	in	time	of	war	is	a	thankless	task.	The stay-at-homes	will	not	believe,	and	particularly	they	whose	smug	respectability and	conventional	religion	has	been	put	to	no	such	fiery	trial.	Moreover	they	will

do	more	than	disbelieve;	they	will	say	that	the	story	is	not	fit	to	be	told.	Nor	is	it.

But	then	it	should	never	have	been	lived.	That	very	respectability,	that	very conventionality,	that	very	contented	backboneless	religion	made	it	possible—all but	made	it	necessary.	For	it	was	those	things	which	allowed	the	world	to	drift into	the	war,	and	what	the	war	was	nine	days	out	of	ten	ought	to	be	thrust	under the	eyes	of	those	who	will	not	believe.	It	is	a	small	thing	that	men	die	in	battle, for	a	man	has	but	one	life	to	live	and	it	is	good	to	give	it	for	one's	friends;	but	it is	such	an	evil	that	it	has	no	like,	this	drifting	of	a	world	into	a	hell	to	which men's	souls	are	driven	like	red	maple	leaves	before	the	autumn	wind.

The	old-fashioned	pious	books	made	hell	stink	of	brimstone	and	painted	the Devil	hideous.	But	Satan	is	not	such	a	fool.	Champagne	and	Martinis	do	not taste	like	Gregory	powder,	nor	was	St.	Anthony	tempted	by	shrivelled	hags.

Paganism	can	be	gay,	and	passion	look	like	love.	Moreover,	still	more	truly, Christ	could	see	the	potentiality	of	virtue	in	Mary	Magdalene	and	of	strength	in Simon	called	Peter.	The	conventional	religious	world	does	not.

A	curious	feature,	too,	of	that	strange	life	was	its	lack	of	consecutiveness.	It	was like	the	pages	of	 La	Vie	Parisienne.	The	friend	of	to-day	was	gone	for	ever	to-morrow.	A	man	arrived,	weary	and	dirty	and	craving	for	excitement,	in	some unknown	town;	in	half	an	hour	he	had	stepped	into	the	gay	glitter	of	wine	and women's	smiles;	in	half	a	dozen	he	had	been	whirled	away.	The	days	lingered and	yet	flew;	the	pages	were	twirled	ever	more	dazzlingly;	only	at	the	end	men saw	in	a	blinding	flash	whither	they	had	been	led.

These	things,	then,	are	set	out	in	this	book.	This	is	its	atmosphere.	They	are	truly set	out.	They	are	not	white-washed;	still	less	are	they	pictured	as	men	might have	seen	them	in	more	sober	moments,	as	the	Puritan	world	would	see	them now.	Nor	does	the	book	set	forth	the	author's	judgment,	for	that	is	not	his	idea	of a	novel.	It	sets	out	what	Peter	and	Julie	saw	and	did,	and	what	it	appeared	to them	to	be	while	they	did	it.	Very	probably,	then,	the	average	reader	had	better read	no	further	than	this….

But	at	any	rate	let	him	not	read	further	than	is	written.	The	last	page	has	been	left blank.	It	has	been	left	blank	for	a	reason,	because	the	curtain	falls	not	on	the conclusion	of	the	lives	of	those	who	have	stepped	upon	the	boards,	but	at	a psychological	moment	in	their	story.	The	Lord	has	turned	to	look	upon	Peter, and	Julie	has	seen	that	He	has	looked.	It	is	enough;	they	were	happy	who,	going down	into	the	Valley	of	the	Shadow	of	Death,	saw	a	vision	of	God's	love	even

there.	For	the	Christ	of	Calvary	moved	to	His	Cross	again	but	a	few	short	years ago;	and	it	is	enough	in	one	book	to	tell	how	Simon	failed	to	follow,	but	how Jesus	turned	to	look	on	Peter.

Ah!	is	Thy	love	indeed

A	weed,	albeit	an	amaranthine	weed,

Suffering	no	flowers	except	its	own	to	mount?

Ah!	must—

Designer	infinite!—

Ah!	must	Thou	char	the	wood	ere	Thou	canst	limn	with	it?

CHAPTER	I

London	lay	as	if	washed	with	water-colour	that	Sunday	morning,	light	blue	sky and	pale	dancing	sunlight	wooing	the	begrimed	stones	of	Westminster	like	a young	girl	with	an	old	lover.	The	empty	streets,	clean-swept,	were	bathed	in	the light,	and	appeared	to	be	transformed	from	the	streets	of	week-day	life.	Yet	the half	of	Londoners	lay	late	abed,	perhaps	because	six	mornings	a	week	of	reality made	them	care	little	for	one	of	magic.

Peter,	nevertheless,	saw	little	of	this	beauty.	He	walked	swiftly	as	always,	and	he looked	about	him,	but	he	noticed	none	of	these	things.	True,	a	fluttering	sheet	of newspaper	headlines	impaled	on	the	railings	of	St.	Margaret's	held	him	for	a second,	but	that	was	because	its	message	was	the	one	that	rang	continually	in	his head,	and	had	nothing	at	all	to	do	with	the	beauty	of	things	that	he	passed	by.

He	was	a	perfectly	dressed	young	man,	in	a	frock	coat	and	silk	hat	of	the	London clergyman,	and	he	was	on	his	way	to	preach	at	St.	John's	at	the	morning	service.

Walking	always	helped	him	to	prepare	his	sermons,	and	this	sermon	would ordinarily	have	struck	him	as	one	well	worth	preparing.	The	pulpit	of	St.	John's marked	a	rung	up	in	the	ladder	for	him.	That	great	fashionable	church	of	mid-Victorian	faith	and	manners	held	a	congregation	on	Sunday	mornings	for	which the	Rector	catered	with	care.	It	said	a	good	deal	for	Peter	that	he	had	been invited	to	preach.	He	ought	to	have	had	his	determined	scheme	plain	before	him, and	a	few	sentences,	carefully	polished,	at	hand	for	the	beginning	and	the	end.

He	could	trust	himself	in	the	middle,	and	was	perfectly	conscious	of	that.	He frankly	liked	preaching,	liked	it	not	merely	as	an	actor	loves	to	sway	his audience,	but	liked	it	because	he	always	knew	what	to	say,	and	was	really	keen that	people	should	see	his	argument.	And	yet	this	morning,	when	he	should	have been	prepared	for	the	best	he	could	do,	he	was	not	prepared	at	all.

Strictly,	that	is	not	quite	true,	for	he	had	a	text,	and	the	text	absolutely	focused his	thought.	But	it	was	too	big	for	him.	Like	some	at	least	in	England	that	day,	he

was	conscious	of	staring	down	a	lane	of	tragedy	that	appalled	him.	Fragments and	sentences	came	and	went	in	his	head.	He	groped	for	words,	mentally,	as	he walked.	Over	and	over	again	he	repeated	his	text.	It	amazed	him	by	its simplicity;	it	horrified	him	by	its	depth.

Hilda	was	waiting	at	the	pillar-box	as	she	had	said	she	would	be,	and	little	as	she could	guess	it,	she	irritated	him.	He	did	not	want	her	just	then.	He	could	hardly tell	why,	except	that,	somehow,	she	ran	counter	to	his	thoughts	altogether	that morning.	She	seemed,	even	in	her	excellent	brown	costume	that	fitted	her	fine figure	so	well,	out	of	place,	and	out	of	place	for	the	first	time.

They	were	not	openly	engaged,	these	two,	but	there	was	an	understanding between	them,	and	an	understanding	that	her	family	was	slowly	recognising.	Mr.

Lessing,	at	first,	would	never	have	accepted	an	engagement,	for	he	had	other ideas	for	his	daughter	of	the	big	house	in	Park	Lane.	The	rich	city	merchant, church-warden	at	St.	John's,	important	in	his	party,	and	a	person	of	distinction when	at	his	club,	would	have	been	seriously	annoyed	that	his	daughter	should consider	a	marriage	with	a	curate	whose	gifts	had	not	yet	made	him	an	income.

But	he	recognised	that	the	young	man	might	go	far.	"Young	Graham?"	he	would say,	"Yes,	a	clever	young	fellow,	with	quite	remarkable	gifts,	sir.	Bishop	thinks	a lot	of	him,	I	believe.	Preaches	extraordinarily	well.	The	Rector	said	he	would	ask him	to	St.	John's	one	morning…."

Peter	Graham's	parish	ran	down	to	the	river,	and	included	slums	in	which	some of	the	ladies	of	St.	John's	(whose	congregation	had	seen	to	it	that	in	their immediate	neighbourhood	there	were	no	such	things)	were	interested.	So	the	two had	met.	She	had	found	him	admirable	and	likeable;	he	found	her	highly respectable	and	seemingly	unapproachable.	From	which	cold	elements	much more	may	come	than	one	might	suppose.

At	any	rate,	now,	Mrs.	Lessing	said	nothing	when	Hilda	went	to	post	a	letter	in London	on	Sunday	morning	before	breakfast.	She	would	have	mildly remonstrated	if	the	girl	had	gone	to	meet	the	young	man.	The	which	was England	once,	and	may,	despite	the	Kaiser,	be	England	yet	once	more.

"I	was	nearly	going,"	she	declared.	"You're	a	bit	late."

"I	know,"	he	replied;	"I	couldn't	help	it.	The	early	service	took	longer	than	usual.

But	I'm	glad	to	see	you	before	breakfast.	Tell	me,	what	does	your	father	think	of

it	all?"

The	girl	gave	a	little	shrug	of	the	shoulders,	"Oh,	he	says	war	is	impossible.	The credit	system	makes	it	impossible.	But	if	he	really	thinks	so,	I	don't	see	why	he should	say	it	so	often	and	so	violently.	Oh,	Peter,	what	do	you	think?"

The	young	man	unconsciously	quickened	his	pace.	"I	think	it	is	certain,"	he	said.

"We	must	come	in.	I	should	say,	more	likely,	the	credit	system	makes	it impossible	for	us	to	keep	out.	I	mean,	half	Europe	can't	go	to	war	and	we	sit	still.

Not	in	these	days.	And	if	it	comes—Good	Lord,	Hilda,	do	you	know	what	it means?	I	can't	see	the	end,	only	it	looks	to	me	like	being	a	fearful	smash….	Oh, we	shall	pull	through,	but	nobody	seems	to	see	that	our	ordinary	life	will	come down	like	a	pack	of	cards.	And	what	will	the	poor	do?	And	can't	you	see	the masses	of	poor	souls	that	will	be	thrown	into	the	vortex	like,	like…."	He	broke off.	"I	can't	find	words,"	he	said,	gesticulating	nervously.	"It's	colossal."

"Peter,	you're	going	to	preach	about	it:	I	can	see	you	are.	But	do	take	care	what you	say.	I	should	hate	father	to	be	upset.	He's	so—oh,	I	don't	know!— British,	I think.	He	hates	to	be	thrown	out,	you	know,	and	he	won't	think	all	that	possible."

She	glanced	up	(the	least	little	bit	that	she	had	to)	anxiously.	Graham	smiled.	"I know	Mr.	Lessing,"	he	said.	"But,	Hilda,	he's	 got	to	be	moved.	Why,	he	may	be in	khaki	yet!"

"Oh,	Peter,	don't	be	silly.	Why,	father's	fifty,	and	not	exactly	in	training,"	she laughed.	Then,	seriously:	"But	for	goodness'	sake	don't	say	such	things—for	my sake,	anyway."

Peter	regarded	her	gravely,	and	held	open	the	gate.	"I'll	remember,"	he	said,	"but more	unlikely	things	may	happen	than	that."

They	went	up	the	path	together,	and	Hilda	slipped	a	key	into	the	door.	As	it opened,	a	thought	seemed	to	strike	her	for	the	first	time.	"What	will	 you	do?"	she demanded	suddenly.

Mrs.	Lessing	was	just	going	into	the	dining-room,	and	Peter	had	no	need	to reply.	"Good-morning,	Mr.	Graham,"	she	said,	coming	forward	graciously.	"I wondered	if	Hilda	would	meet	you:	she	wanted	to	post	a	letter.	Come	in.	You must	be	hungry	after	your	walk."

A	manservant	held	the	door	open,	and	they	all	went	in.	That	magic	sun	shone	on the	silver	of	the	breakfast-table,	and	lit	up	the	otherwise	heavy	room.	Mrs.

Lessing	swung	the	cover	of	a	silver	dish	and	the	eggs	slipped	in	to	boil.	She touched	a	button	on	the	table	and	sat	down,	just	as	Mr.	Lessing	came	rather ponderously	forward	with	a	folded	newspaper	in	his	hand.

"Morning,	Graham,"	he	said.	"Morning,	Hilda.	Been	out,	eh?	Well,	well,	lovely morning	out;	makes	one	feel	ten	years	younger.	But	what	do	you	think	of	all	this, Graham?"	waving	the	paper	as	he	spoke.

Peter	just	caught	the	portentous	headline—

"GERMANY	DECLARES	WAR	ON	RUSSIA,"

as	he	pulled	up	to	the	table,	but	he	did	not	need	to	see	it.	There	was	really	no news:	only	that.	"It	is	certain,	I	think,	sir,"	he	said.

"Oh,	certain,	certain,"	said	Lessing,	seating	himself.	"The	telegrams	say	they	are over	the	frontier	of	Luxembourg	and	massing	against	France.	Grey	can't	stop	'em now,	but	the	world	won't	stand	it—can't	stand	it.	There	can't	be	a	long	war.

Probably	it's	all	a	big	bluff	again;	they	know	in	Berlin	that	business	can't	stand	a war,	or	at	any	rate	a	long	war.	And	we	needn't	come	in.	In	the	City,	yesterday, they	said	the	Government	could	do	more	by	standing	out.	We're	not	pledged.

Anderson	told	me	Asquith	said	so	distinctly.	And,	thank	God,	the	Fleet's	ready!

It's	madness,	madness,	and	we	must	keep	our	heads.	That's	what	I	say,	anyway."

Graham	cracked	an	egg	mechanically.	His	sermon	was	coming	back	to	him.	He saw	a	congregation	of	Lessings,	and	more	clearly	than	ever	the	other	things.

"What	about	Belgium?"	he	queried.	"Surely	our	honour	is	engaged	there?"

Mr.	Lessing	pulled	up	his	napkin,	visibly	perturbed.	"Yes,	but	what	can	we	do?"

he	demanded.	"What	is	the	good	of	flinging	a	handful	of	troops	overseas,	even	if we	can?	It's	incredible—English	troops	in	Flanders	in	this	century.	In	my opinion—in	my	opinion,	I	say—we	should	do	better	to	hold	ourselves	in readiness.	Germany	would	never	really	dare	antagonise	us.	They	know	what	it involves.	Why,	there's	hundreds	of	millions	of	pounds	at	stake.	Grey	has	only	to be	firm,	and	things	must	come	right.	Must—absolutely	must."

"Annie	said,	this	morning,	that	she	heard	everyone	in	the	streets	last	night	say	we

must	fight,	father,"	put	in	Hilda.

"Pooh!"	exclaimed	the	city	personage,	touched	now	on	the	raw.	"What	do	the fools	know	about	it?	I	suppose	the	 Daily	Mail	will	scream,	but,	thank	God,	this country	has	not	quite	gone	to	the	dogs	yet.	The	people,	indeed!	The	mass	of	the country	is	solid	for	sense	and	business,	and	trusts	the	Government.	Of	course, the	Tory	press	will	make	the	whole	question	a	party	lever	if	it	can,	but	it	can't.

What!	Are	we	going	to	be	pushed	into	war	by	a	mob	and	a	few	journalists?	Why, Labour	even	will	be	dead	against	it.	Come,	Graham,	you	ought	to	know something	about	that.	More	in	your	line	than	mine—don't	you	think	so?"

"You	really	ought	not	to	let	the	maids	talk	so,"	said	Mrs.	Lessing	gently.

Peter	glanced	at	her	with	a	curiously	hopeless	feeling,	and	looked	slowly	round the	room	until	his	eyes	rested	on	Mr.	Lessing's	portrait	over	the	mantelshelf, presented	by	the	congregation	of	St.	John's	on	some	occasion	two	years	before.

From	the	portrait	he	turned	to	the	gentleman,	but	it	was	not	necessary	for	him	to speak.	Mr.	Lessing	was	saying	something	to	the	man—probably	ordering	the	car.

He	glanced	across	at	Hilda,	who	had	made	some	reply	to	her	mother	and	was toying	with	a	spoon.	He	thought	he	had	never	seen	her	look	more	handsome and….	He	could	not	find	the	word:	thought	of	"solid,"	and	then	smiled	at	the thought.	It	did	not	fit	in	with	the	sunlight	on	her	hair.

"Well,	well,"	said	Mr.	Lessing;	"we	ought	to	make	a	move.	It	won't	do	for	either of	us	to	be	late,	Mr.	Preacher."

The	congregation	of	St.	John's	assembled	on	a	Sunday	morning	as	befitted	its importance	and	dignity.	Families	arrived,	or	arrived	by	two	or	three representatives,	and	proceeded	with	due	solemnity	to	their	private	pews.	No	one, of	course,	exchanged	greetings	on	the	way	up	the	church,	but	every	lady	became aware,	not	only	of	the	other	ladies	present,	but	of	what	each	wore.	A	sidesman, with	an	air	of	portentous	gravity,	as	one	who,	in	opening	doors,	performed	an office	more	on	behalf	of	the	Deity	than	the	worshippers,	was	usually	at	hand	to usher	the	party	in.	Once	there,	there	was	some	stir	of	orderly	bustle:	kneelers were	distributed	according	to	requirements,	books	sorted	out	after	the	solemn unlocking	of	the	little	box	that	contained	them,	sticks	and	hats	safely	stowed away.	These	duties	performed,	paterfamilias	cast	one	penetrating	glance	round the	church,	and	leaned	gracefully	forward	with	a	kind	of	circular	motion.	Having suitably	addressed	Almighty	God	(it	is	to	be	supposed),	he	would	lean	back,

adjust	his	trousers,	possibly	place	an	elbow	on	the	pew-door,	and	contemplate with	a	fixed	and	determined	gaze	the	distant	altar.

Peter,	of	course,	wound	in	to	solemn	music	with	the	procession	of	choir	boys	and men,	and,	accorded	the	honour	of	a	beadle	with	a	silver	mace,	since	he	was	to preach,	was	finally	installed	in	a	suitably	cushioned	seat	within	the	altar-rails.	He knelt	to	pray,	but	it	was	an	effort	to	formulate	anything.	He	was	intensely conscious	that	morning	that	a	meaning	hitherto	unfelt	and	unguessed	lay	behind his	world,	and	even	behind	all	this	pomp	and	ceremony	that	he	knew	so	well.

Rising,	of	course,	when	the	senior	curate	began	to	intone	the	opening	sentence	in a	manner	which	one	felt	was	worthy	even	of	St.	John's,	he	allowed	himself	to study	his	surroundings	as	never	before.

The	church	had,	indeed,	an	air	of	great	beauty	in	the	morning	sunlight.	The Renaissance	galleries	and	woodwork,	mellowed	by	time,	were	dusted	by	that soft	warm	glow,	and	the	somewhat	sparse	congregation,	in	its	magnificently isolated	groups,	was	humanised	by	it	too.	The	stone	of	the	chancel,	flecked	with colour,	had	a	quiet	dignity,	and	even	the	altar,	ecclesiastically	ludicrous,	had	a grace	of	its	own.	There	was	to	be	a	celebration	after	Matins.	The	historic	gold plate	was	therefore	arranged	on	the	retable	with	something	of	the	effect	of	show pieces	at	Mappin	and	Webb's.	Peter	noticed	three	flagons,	and	between	them	two patens	of	great	size.	A	smaller	pair	for	use	stood	on	the	credence-table.	The	gold chalice	and	paten,	veiled,	stood	on	the	altar-table	itself,	and	above	them,	behind, rose	the	cross	and	two	vases	of	hot-house	lilies.	Suggesting	one	of	the	great shields	of	beaten	gold	that	King	Solomon	had	made	for	the	Temple	of	Jerusalem, an	alms-dish	stood	on	edge,	and	leant	against	the	retable	to	the	right	of	the	veiled chalice.	Peter	found	himself	marvelling	at	its	size,	but	was	recalled	to	his position	when	it	became	necessary	to	kneel	for	the	Confession.

The	service	followed	its	accustomed	course,	and	throughout	the	whole	of	it	Peter was	conscious	of	his	chaotic	sermon.	He	glanced	at	his	notes	occasionally,	and then	put	them	resolutely	away,	well	aware	that	they	would	be	all	but	useless	to him.	Either	he	would,	at	the	last,	be	able	to	formulate	the	thoughts	that	raced through	his	head,	or	else	he	could	do	no	more	than	occupy	the	pulpit	for	the conventional	twenty	minutes	with	a	conventional	sermon.	At	times	he	half thought	he	would	follow	this	easier	course,	but	then	the	great	letters	of	the newspaper	poster	seemed	to	frame	themselves	before	him,	and	he	knew	he	could not.	And	so,	at	last,	there	was	the	bowing	beadle	with	the	silver	mace,	and	he must	set	out	on	the	little	dignified	procession	to	the	great	Jacobean	pulpit	with	its

velvet	cushion	at	the	top.

Hilda's	mind	was	a	curious	study	during	that	sermon.	At	first,	as	her	lover's rather	close-cropped,	dark-haired	head	appeared	in	sight,	she	had	studied	him with	an	odd	mixture	of	pride	and	apprehension.	She	held	her	hymn-book,	but	she did	not	need	it,	and	she	watched	surreptitiously	while	he	opened	the	Bible, arranged	some	papers,	and,	in	accordance	with	custom,	knelt	to	pray.	She	began to	think	half-thoughts	of	the	days	that	might	be,	when	perhaps	she	would	be	the wife	of	the	Rector	of	some	St.	John's,	and	later,	possibly,	of	a	Bishop.	Peter	had it	in	him	to	go	far,	she	knew.	She	half	glanced	round	with	a	self-conscious feeling	that	people	might	be	guessing	at	her	thoughts,	and	then	back,	wondering suddenly	if	she	really	knew	the	man,	or	only	the	minister.	And	then	there	came the	rustle	of	shutting	books	and	of	people	composing	themselves	to	listen,	the few	coughs,	the	vague	suggestion	of	hassocks	and	cushions	being	made comfortable.	And	then,	in	a	moment,	almost	with	the	giving	out	of	the	text,	the sudden	stillness	and	that	tense	sensation	which	told	that	the	young	orator	had gripped	his	congregation.

Thereafter	she	hardly	heard	him,	as	it	were,	and	she	certainly	lost	the	feeling	of ownership	that	had	been	hers	before.	As	he	leaned	over	the	pulpit,	and	the	words rang	out	almost	harshly	from	their	intensity,	she	began	to	see,	as	the	rest	of	the congregation	began	to	see,	the	images	that	the	preacher	conjured	up	before	her.

A	sense	of	coming	disaster	riveted	her—the	feeling	that	she	was	already watching	the	end	of	an	age.

"Jesus	had	compassion	on	the	multitude"—that	had	been	the	short	and	simple text.	Simple	words,	the	preacher	had	said,	but	how	when	one	realised	Who	had had	compassion,	and	on	what?	Almighty	God	Himself,	with	His	incarnate	Mind set	on	the	working	out	of	immense	and	agelong	plans,	had,	as	it	were,	paused	for a	moment	to	have	compassion	on	hungry	women	and	crying	babies	and	folk whose	petty	confused	affairs	could	have	seemed	of	no	consequence	to	anyone	in the	drama	of	the	world.	And	then,	with	a	few	terse	sentences,	the	preacher swung	from	that	instance	to	the	world	drama	of	to-day.	Did	they	realise,	he asked,	that	peaceful	bright	Sunday	morning,	that	millions	of	simple	men	were	at that	moment	being	hurled	at	each	other	to	maim	and	kill?	At	the	bidding	of powers	that	even	they	could	hardly	visualise,	at	the	behest	of	world	politics	that not	one	in	a	thousand	would	understand	and	scarcely	any	justify,	houses	were being	broken	up,	women	were	weeping,	and	children	playing	in	the	sun	before cottage	doors	were	even	now	being	left	fatherless.	It	was	incredible,	colossal,

unimaginable,	but	as	one	tried	to	picture	it,	Hell	had	opened	her	mouth	and Death	gone	forth	to	slay.	It	was	terrible	enough	that	battlefields	of	stupendous size	should	soon	be	littered	with	the	dying	and	the	dead,	but	the	aftermath	of such	a	war	as	this	would	be	still	more	terrible.	No	one	could	say	how	near	it would	come	to	them	all.	No	one	could	tell	what	revolution	in	morals	and	social order	such	a	war	as	this	might	not	bring.	That	day	God	Himself	looked	down	on the	multitude	as	sheep	having	no	shepherd,	abandoned	to	be	butchered	by	the wolves,	and	His	heart	beat	with	a	divine	compassion	for	the	infinite	sorrows	of the	world.

There	was	little	more	to	it.	An	exhortation	to	go	home	to	fear	and	pray	and	set the	house	in	order	against	the	Day	of	Wrath,	and	that	was	all.	"My	brethren,"

said	the	young	man—and	the	intensity	of	his	thought	lent	a	certain	unusual solemnity	to	the	conventional	title—"no	one	can	tell	how	the	events	of	this	week may	affect	us.	Our	feet	may	even	now	be	going	down	into	the	Valley	of	the Shadow	of	temptation,	of	conflict,	of	death,	and	even	now	there	may	be preparing	for	us	a	chalice	such	as	we	shall	fear	to	drink.	Let	us	pray	that	in	that hour	the	compassion	of	Jesus	may	be	real	to	us,	and	we	ourselves	find	a	sure place	in	that	sorrowful	Heart."

And	he	was	gone	from	the	pulpit	without	another	word.	It	would	have	been almost	ridiculous	if	one	had	noted	that	the	surprised	beadle	had	had	no	"And now	to	God	the	Father	…"	in	which	to	reach	the	pulpit,	and	had	been	forced	to meet	his	victim	hurrying	halfway	up	the	chancel;	but	perhaps	no	one	but	that dignitary,	whom	the	fall	of	thrones	would	not	shake,	had	noticed	it.	The congregation	paid	the	preacher	the	great	compliment	of	sitting	on	in	absolute silence	for	a	minute	or	two.	For	a	moment	it	still	stared	reality	in	the	face.	And then	Mr.	Lessing	shifted	in	his	pew	and	coughed,	and	the	Rector	rose, pompously	as	usual,	to	announce	the	hymn,	and	Hilda	became	conscious	of unaccustomed	tears	in	her	eyes.

The	senior	curate	solemnly	uncovered	and	removed	the	chalice.	Taking	bread and	wine,	he	deposited	the	sacred	vessels	at	the	north	end	of	the	altar,	returned	to the	centre,	unfolded	the	corporal,	received	the	alms,	and	as	solemnly	set	the great	gold	dish	on	the	corporal	itself,	after	the	unmeaning	custom	of	the	church.

And	then	came	the	long	prayer	and	the	solemn	procession	to	the	vestry,	while	a dozen	or	two	stayed	with	the	senior	curate	for	the	Communion.

Graham	found	himself	in	the	little	inner	vestry,	with	its	green-cloth	table	and

massive	inkstand	and	registers,	and	began	to	unvest	mechanically.	He	got	his coat	out	of	the	beautiful	carved	wardrobe,	and	was	folding	up	his	hood	and surplice,	when	the	Rector	laid	a	patronising	hand	on	his	shoulder.	"A	good sermon,	Graham,"	he	said—"a	good	sermon,	if	a	little	emotional.	It	was	a	pity you	forgot	the	doxology.	But	it	is	a	great	occasion,	I	fear	a	greater	occasion	than we	know,	and	you	rose	to	it	very	well.	Last	night	I	had	half	a	mind	to	'phone	you not	to	come,	and	to	preach	myself,	but	I	am	glad	now	I	did	not.	I	am	sure	we	are very	grateful.	Eh,	Sir	Robert?"

Sir	Robert	Doyle,	the	other	warden,	was	making	neat	piles	of	sovereigns	on	the green	cloth,	while	Mr.	Lessing	counted	the	silver	as	to	the	manner	born.	He	was a	pillar	of	the	church,	too,	was	Sir	Robert,	but	a	soldier	and	a	straight	speaker.

He	turned	genially	to	the	young	man.

"From	the	shoulder,	Rector,"	he	said.	"Perhaps	it	will	make	a	few	of	us	sit	up	a little.	Coming	down	to	church	I	met	Arnold	of	the	War	Office,	and	he	said	war was	certain.	Of	course	it	is.	Germany	has	been	playing	up	for	it	for	years,	and	we fools	have	been	blind	and	mad.	But	it'll	come	now.	Thank	God,	I	can	still	do	a bit,	and	maybe	we	shall	meet	out	there	yet—eh,	Mr.	Graham?"

Somehow	or	another	that	aspect	of	the	question	had	not	struck	Peter	forcibly	till now.	He	had	been	so	occupied	with	visualising	the	march	of	world	events	that	he had	hardly	thought	of	himself	as	one	of	the	multitude.	But	now	the	question struck	home.	What	would	he	do?	He	was	at	a	loss	for	the	moment.

The	Rector	saved	him,	however.	"Well,	well,	of	course,	Sir	Robert,	apart	from the	chaplains,	the	place	of	the	clergy	will	be	almost	certainly	at	home.	Hospital visiting,	and	so	on,	will	take	a	lot	of	time.	I	believe	the	Chaplain-General's Department	is	fully	staffed,	but	doubtless,	if	there	is	any	demand,	the	clergy	will respond.	It	is,	of	course,	against	Canon	Law	for	them	to	fight,	though	doubtless our	young	friend	would	like	to	do	his	share	in	that	if	he	could.	You	were	in	the O.T.C.	at	Oxford,	weren't	you,	Graham?"

"Yes,"	said	Graham	shortly.

"The	French	priests	are	mobilising	with	the	nation,"	said	Sir	Robert.

"Ah,	yes,	naturally,"	replied	the	Rector;	"that	is	one	result	of	the	recent	anti-clerical	legislation.	Thank	God,	this	country	has	been	spared	that,	and	in	any case	we	shall	never	have	conscription.	Probably	the	Army	will	have	to	be

enlarged—half	a	million	will	be	required	at	least,	I	should	think.	That	will	mean more	chaplains,	but	I	should	suppose	the	Bishops	will	select—oh,	yes,	surely their	lordships	will	select.	It	would	be	a	pity	for	you	to	go,	Graham;	it's	rough work	with	the	Tommies,	and	your	gifts	are	wanted	at	home.	The	Vicar	of	St.

Thomas's	speaks	very	highly	of	your	gifts	as	an	organiser,	and	doubtless	some sphere	will	be	opened	up	for	you.	Well,	well,	these	are	stirring	times.	Good-morning,	Mr.	Graham."

He	held	out	his	hand	to	the	young	man.	Mr.	Lessing,	carefully	smoothing	his	silk hat,	looked	up.	"Come	in	to	luncheon	with	us,	will	you,	Graham?"	he	said.

Peter	assented,	and	shook	hands	all	round.	Sir	Robert	and	he	moved	out	together, and	the	baronet	caught	his	eye	in	the	porch.	"This'll	jog	him	up	a	bit,	I'm thinking,"	he	said	to	himself.	"There's	stuff	in	that	chap,	but	he's	got	to	feel	his legs."

Outside	the	summer	sun	was	now	powerful,	and	the	streets	were	dusty	and	more busy.	The	crowd	had	thinned	at	the	church	door,	but	Hilda	and	Mrs.	Lessing were	waiting	for	the	car.

"Don't	let's	drive,"	said	Hilda	as	they	came	up;	"I'd	much	sooner	walk	home	to-day."

Her	father	smiled	paternally.	"Bit	cramped	after	church,	eh?"	he	said.

"Well,	what	do	you	say,	dear?"	he	asked	his	wife.

"I	think	I	shall	drive,"	Mrs.	Lessing	replied;	"but	if	Mr.	Graham	is	coming	to luncheon,	perhaps	he	will	walk	round	with	Hilda.	Will	you,	Mr.	Graham?"

"With	pleasure,"	said	Peter.	"I	agree	with	Miss	Lessing,	and	the	walk	will	be jolly.	We'll	go	through	the	park.	It's	less	than	half	an	hour,	isn't	it?"

It	was	arranged	at	that,	and	the	elders	drove	off.	Peter	raised	his	hat	to	Sir Robert,	who	turned	up	the	street,	and	together	he	and	Hilda	crossed	over	the wide	thoroughfare	and	started	down	for	the	park.

There	was	silence	for	a	little,	and	it	was	Peter	who	broke	it.

"Just	before	breakfast,"	he	said,	"you	asked	me	what	I	should	do,	and	I	had	no chance	to	reply.	Well,	they	were	talking	of	it	in	the	vestry	just	now,	and	I've

made	up	my	mind.	I	shall	write	to-night	to	the	Bishop	and	ask	for	a	chaplaincy."

They	walked	on	a	hundred	yards	or	so	in	silence	again.	Then	Hilda	broke	it.

"Peter,"	she	began,	and	stopped.	He	glanced	at	her	quickly,	and	saw	in	a	minute that	the	one	word	had	spoken	truly	to	him.

"Oh,	Hilda,"	he	said,	"do	you	really	care	all	that?	You	can't	possibly!	Oh,	if	we were	not	here,	and	I	could	tell	you	all	I	feel!	But,	dear,	I	love	you;	I	know	now that	I	have	loved	you	for	months,	and	it	is	just	because	I	love	you	that	I	must go."

"Peter,"	began	Hilda	again,	and	again	stopped.	Then	she	took	a	grip	of	herself, and	spoke	out	bravely.	"Oh,	Peter,"	she	said,	"you've	guessed	right.	I	never meant	you	to—at	least,	not	yet,	but	it	is	terrible	to	think	of	you	going	out	there.	I suppose	I	ought	to	be	glad	and	proud,	and	in	a	way	I	am,	but	you	don't	seem	the right	person	for	it.	It's	wasting	you.	And	I	don't	know	what	I	shall	do	without you.	You've	become	the	centre	of	my	life.	I	count	on	seeing	you,	and	on	working with	you.	If	you	go,	you,	you	may	…	Oh,	I	can't	say	it!	I	ought	not	to	say	all	this.

But…"	She	broke	off	abruptly.

Graham	glanced	round	him.	They	were	in	the	park	now,	and	no	one	in	particular was	about	in	the	quiet	of	the	sidewalk.	He	put	his	hand	out,	and	drew	her	gently to	a	seat.	Then,	leaning	forward	and	poking	at	the	ground	with	his	stick,	he began.	"Hilda,	darling,"	he	said,	"it's	awful	to	have	to	speak	to	you	just	now	and just	like	this,	but	I	must.	First,	about	ourselves.	I	love	you	with	all	my	heart,	only that's	so	little	to	say;	I	love	you	so	much	that	you	fill	my	life.	And	I	have	planned my	life	with	you.	I	hardly	knew	it,	but	I	had.	I	thought	I	should	just	go	on	and get	a	living	and	marry	you—perhaps,	if	you	would	(I	can	hardly	speak	of	it	now I	know	you	would)—and—and—oh,	I	don't	know—make	a	name	in	the	Church, I	suppose.	Well,	and	I	hope	we	shall	one	day,	but	now	this	has	come	along.	I really	feel	all	I	said	this	morning,	awfully.	I	shall	go	out—I	must.	The	men	must be	helped;	one	can't	sit	still	and	imagine	them	dying,	wounded,	tempted,	and without	a	priest.	It's	a	supreme	chance.	We	shall	be	fighting	for	honour	and	truth, and	the	Church	must	be	there	to	bear	her	witness	and	speak	her	message.	There will	be	no	end	to	do.	And	it	is	a	chance	of	a	lifetime	to	get	into	touch	with	the men,	and	understand	them.	You	do	see	that,	don't	you?	And,	besides—forgive me,	but	I	must	put	it	so—if	 He	had	compassion	on	the	multitude,	ought	we	not	to have	too? He	showed	it	by	death;	ought	we	to	fear	even	that	too?"

The	girl	stole	out	a	hand,	and	his	gripped	it	hard.	Then	she	remembered	the conventions	and	pulled	it	away,	and	sat	a	little	more	upright.	She	was extraordinarily	conscious	of	herself,	and	she	felt	as	if	she	had	two	selves	that day.	One	was	Hilda	Lessing,	a	girl	she	knew	quite	well,	a	well-trained	person who	understood	life,	and	the	business	of	society	and	of	getting	married,	quite correctly;	and	the	other	was	somebody	she	did	not	know	at	all,	that	could	not reason,	and	who	felt	naked	and	ashamed.	It	was	inexplicable,	but	it	was	so.	That second	self	was	listening	to	heroics	and	even	talking	them,	and	surely	heroics were	a	little	out	of	date.

She	looked	across	a	wide	green	space,	and	saw,	through	the	distant	trees,	the procession	of	the	church	parade.	She	felt	as	if	she	ought	to	be	there,	and	half unconsciously	glanced	at	her	dress.	A	couple	of	terriers	ran	scurrying	across	the grass,	and	a	seat-ticket	man	came	round	the	corner.	Behind	them	a	taxi	hooted, and	some	sparrows	broke	out	into	a	noisy	chatter	in	a	bush.	And	here	was	Peter talking	of	death,	and	the	Cross—and	out	of	church,	too.

She	gave	a	little	shudder,	and	glanced	at	a	wrist-watch.	"Peter,"	she	said,	"we must	go.	Dear,	for	my	sake,	do	think	it	over.	Wait	a	little,	and	see	what	happens.

I	quite	understand	your	point	of	view,	but	you	must	think	of	others—even	your Vicar,	my	parents,	and	of	me.	And	Peter,	shall	we	say	anything	about	our—our love?	What	do	you	think?"

Peter	Graham	looked	at	her	steadily,	and	as	she	spoke	he,	too,	felt	the	contrast between	his	thoughts	and	ordinary	life.	The	London	curate	was	himself	again.

He	got	up.	"Well,	darling,"	he	said,	"just	as	you	like,	but	perhaps	not—at	any rate	until	I	know	what	I	have	to	do.	I'll	think	that	over.	Only,	we	shan't	change, shall	we,	whatever	happens?	You	 do	love	me,	don't	you?	And	I	do	love	you."

Hilda	met	his	gaze	frankly	and	blushed	a	little.	She	held	out	a	hand	to	be	helped up.	"My	dear	boy,"	she	said.

After	luncheon	Peter	smoked	a	cigar	in	the	study	with	Mr.	Lessing	before departure.	Every	detail	of	that	hour	impressed	itself	upon	him	as	had	the	events of	the	day,	for	his	mind	was	strung	up	to	see	the	inner	meaning	of	things	clearly.

They	began	with	the	usual	ritual	of	the	selection	of	chairs	and	cigars,	and	Mr.

Lessing	had	a	glass	of	port	with	his	coffee,	because,	as	he	explained,	his	nerves were	all	on	edge.	Comfortably	stretched	out	in	an	armchair,	blowing	smoke

thoughtfully	towards	the	empty	grate,	his	fat	face	and	body	did	not	seem	capable of	nerves,	still	less	to	be	suffering	from	them,	but	then	one	can	never	tell	from appearances.	At	any	rate	he	chose	his	words	with	care,	and	Graham,	opposite	but sitting	rather	upright,	could	not	but	sense	his	meaning.

"Well,	well,	well,"	he	said,	"to	think	we	should	come	to	this!	A	European	war	in this	century,	and	we	in	it!	Not	that	I'll	believe	it	till	I	hear	it	officially.	While there's	life	there's	hope,	eh,	Graham?"

Peter	nodded,	for	he	did	not	know	what	to	say.

"The	question	is,"	went	on	the	other,	"that	if	we	are	carried	into	war,	what	is	the best	policy?	Some	fools	will	lose	their	heads,	of	course,	and	chuck	everything	to run	into	it.	But	I've	no	use	for	fools,	Graham."

"No,	sir,"	said	Peter.

"No	use	for	fools,"	repeated	Mr.	Lessing.	"I	shall	carry	on	with	business	as	usual, and	I	hope	other	people	will	carry	on	with	theirs.	There	are	plenty	of	men	who can	fight,	and	who	ought	to,	without	disorganising	everything.	Hilda	would	see that	too—she's	such	a	sensible	girl.	Look	at	that	Boer	affair,	and	all	that	foolery about	the	C.I.V.	Why,	I	met	a	South	African	at	the	club	the	other	day	who	said we'd	have	done	ten	times	as	well	without	'em.	You	must	have	trained	men	these days,	and,	after	all,	it's	the	men	behind	the	armies	that	win	the	war.	Men	like	you and	I,	Graham,	each	doing	his	ordinary	job	without	excitement.	That's	the	type that's	made	old	England.	You	ought	to	preach	about	it,	Graham.	Come	to	think,	it fits	in	with	what	you	said	this	morning,	and	a	good	sermon	too,	young	man.

Every	man's	got	to	put	his	house	in	order	and	carry	on.	You	meant	that,	didn't you?"

"Something	like	that,"	said	Peter;	"but	as	far	as	the	clergy	are	concerned,	I	still think	the	Bishops	ought	to	pick	their	men."

"Yes,	yes,	of	course,"	said	Mr.	Lessing,	stretching	himself	a	bit.	"But	I	don't think	the	clergy	could	be	much	use	over	there.	As	the	Canon	said,	there	will	be plenty	to	do	at	home.	In	any	case	it	would	be	no	use	rushing	the	Bishops.	Let them	see	what's	needed,	and	then	let	them	choose	their	men,	eh?	A	man	like London's	sure	to	be	in	the	know.	Good	thing	he's	your	Bishop,	Graham:	you	can leave	it	to	him	easily?"

"I	should	think	so,	sir,"	said	Peter	forlornly.

"Oh,	well,	glad	to	hear	you	say	it,	I'm	sure,	Graham,	and	so	will	Mrs.	Lessing	be, and	Hilda.	We're	old-fashioned	folk,	you	know….	Well,	well,	and	I	suppose	I oughtn't	to	keep	you.	I'll	come	with	you	to	the	door,	my	boy."

He	walked	ahead	of	the	young	man	into	the	hall,	and	handed	him	his	hat	himself.

On	the	steps	they	shook	hands	to	the	fire	of	small	sentences.	"Drop	in	some evening,	won't	you?	Don't	know	if	I	really	congratulated	you	on	the	sermon;	you spoke	extraordinarily	well,	Graham.	You've	a	great	gift.	After	all,	this	war	will give	you	a	bit	of	a	chance,	eh?	We	must	hear	you	again	in	St.	John's….	Good-afternoon."

"Good-afternoon,	Mr.	Lessing,"	said	Graham,	"and	thank	you	for	all	you've said."

In	the	street	he	walked	slowly,	and	he	thought	of	all	Mr.	Lessing	had	not	said	as well	as	all	he	had.	After	all,	he	had	spoken	sound	sense,	and	there	was	Hilda.	He couldn't	lose	Hilda,	and	if	the	old	man	turned	out	obstinate—well,	it	would	be	all but	impossible	to	get	her.	Probably	things	were	not	as	bad	as	he	had	imagined.

Very	likely	it	would	all	be	over	by	Christmas.	If	so,	it	was	not	much	use throwing	everything	up.	Perhaps	he	could	word	the	letter	to	the	Bishop	a	little differently.	He	turned	over	phrases	all	the	way	home,	and	got	them	fairly	pat.

But	it	was	a	busy	evening,	and	he	did	not	write	that	night.

Monday	always	began	as	a	full	day,	what	with	staff	meeting	and	so	on,	and	its being	Bank	Holiday	did	not	make	much	difference	to	them.	But	in	the	afternoon he	was	free	to	read	carefully	the	Sunday	papers,	and	was	appalled	with	the swiftness	of	the	approach	of	the	universal	cataclysm.	After	Evensong	and supper,	then,	he	got	out	paper	and	pen	and	wrote,	though	it	took	much	longer than	he	thought	it	would.	In	the	end	he	begged	the	Bishop	to	remember	him	if	it was	really	necessary	to	find	more	chaplains,	and	expressed	his	readiness	to	serve the	Church	and	the	country	when	he	was	wanted.	When	it	was	written,	he	sat long	over	the	closed	envelope	and	smoked	a	couple	of	pipes.	He	wondered	if men	were	killing	each	other,	even	now,	just	over	the	water.	He	pictured	a	battle scene,	drawing	from	imagination	and	what	he	remembered	of	field-days	at Aldershot.	He	shuddered	a	little	as	he	conceived	himself	crawling	through heather	to	reach	a	man	in	the	front	line	who	had	been	hit,	while	the	enemies'

guns	on	the	crest	opposite	were	firing	as	he	had	seen	them	fire	in	play.	He	tried

to	imagine	what	it	would	be	like	to	be	hit.

Then	he	got	up	and	stretched	himself.	He	looked	round	curiously	at	the bookcase,	the	Oxford	group	or	two,	the	hockey	cap	that	hung	on	the	edge	of	one.

He	turned	to	the	mantelpiece	and	glanced	over	the	photos.	Probably	Bob	Scarlett would	be	out	at	once;	he	was	in	some	Irish	regiment	or	other.	Old	Howson	was in	India;	he	wouldn't	hear	or	see	much.	Jimmy—what	would	Jimmy	do,	now?

He	picked	up	the	photograph	and	looked	at	it—the	clean-shaven,	thoughtful, good-looking	face	of	the	best	fellow	in	the	world,	who	had	got	his	fellowship almost	at	once	after	his	brilliant	degree,	and	was	just	now,	he	reflected,	on holiday	in	the	South	of	France.	Jimmy,	the	idealist,	what	would	Jimmy	do?	He reached	for	a	hat	and	made	for	the	door.	He	would	post	his	letter	that	night	under the	stars.

Once	outside,	he	walked	on	farther	down	Westminster	way.	At	the	Bridge	he leaned	for	a	while	and	watched	the	sullen,	tireless	river,	and	then	turned	to	walk up	past	the	House.	It	was	a	clear,	still	night,	and	the	street	was	fairly	empty.	Big Ben	boomed	eleven,	and	as	he	crossed	in	front	of	the	gates	to	reach	St.

Margaret's	he	wondered	what	was	doing	in	there.	He	had	the	vaguest	notion where	people	like	the	Prime	Minister	and	Sir	Edward	Grey	would	be	that	night.

He	thought	possibly	with	the	King,	or	in	Downing	Street.	And	then	he	heard	his name	being	called,	and	turned	to	see	Sir	Robert	Doyle	coming	towards	him.

The	other's	face	arrested	him.	"Is	there	any	news,	Sir	Robert?"	he	asked.

Sir	Robert	glanced	up	in	his	turn	at	the	great	shining	dial	above	them.	"Our ultimatum	has	gone	or	is	just	going	to	Germany,	and	in	twenty-four	hours	we shall	be	at	war,"	he	said	tersely.	"I'm	just	going	home;	I've	been	promised	a	job."





CHAPTER	II

At	7.10	on	a	foggy	February	morning	Victoria	Station	looked	a	place	of	mystery within	which	a	mighty	work	was	going	forward.	Electric	lights	still	shone	in	the gloom,	and	whereas	innumerable	units	of	life	ran	this	way	and	that	like	ants disturbed,	an	equal	number	stood	about	apparently	indifferent	and	unperturbed.

Tommies	who	had	found	a	place	against	a	wall	or	seat	deposited	rifle	and	pack close	by,	lit	a	pipe,	and	let	the	world	go	by,	content	that	when	the	officers'	leave train	had	gone	someone,	or	some	Providence,	would	round	them	up	as	well.	But, for	the	rest,	porters,	male	and	female,	rushed	up	with	baggage;	trunks	were pushed	through	the	crowd	with	the	usual	objurgations;	subalterns,	mostly	loud and	merry,	greeted	each	other	or	the	officials,	or,	more	subdued,	moved purposefully	through	the	crowd	with	their	women-folk,	intent	on	finding	a quieter	place	farther	up	the	platforms.

There	was	no	mistaking	the	leave	platform	or	the	time	of	the	train,	for	a	great notice	drew	one's	attention	to	it.	Once	there,	the	Army	took	a	man	in	hand.	Peter was	entirely	new	to	the	process,	but	he	speedily	discovered	that	his	fear	of	not knowing	what	to	do	or	where	to	go,	which	had	induced	him	(among	other reasons)	to	say	good-bye	at	home	and	come	alone	to	the	station,	was	unfounded.

Red-caps	passed	him	on	respectfully	but	purposefully	to	officials,	who	looked	at this	paper	and	that,	and	finally	sent	him	up	to	an	officer	who	sat	at	a	little	table with	papers	before	him	to	write	down	the	name,	rank,	unit,	and	destination	of each	individual	destined	that	very	morning	to	leave	for	the	Army	in	France.

Peter	at	last,	then,	was	free	to	walk	up	the	platform,	and	seek	the	rest	of	his luggage	that	had	come	on	from	the	hotel	with	the	porter.	He	was	free,	that	is,	if one	disregarded	the	kit	hung	about	his	person,	or	which,	despite	King's Regulations,	he	carried	in	his	hands.	But	free	or	not,	he	could	not	find	his luggage.	At	7.30	it	struck	him	that	at	least	he	had	better	find	his	seat.	He therefore	entered	a	corridor	and	began	pilgrimage.	It	was	seemingly	hopeless.

The	seats	were	filled	with	coats	or	sticks	or	papers;	every	type	of	officer	was

engaged	in	bestowing	himself	and	his	goods;	and	the	general	atmosphere	struck him	as	being	precisely	that	which	one	experiences	as	a	fresher	when	one	first enters	hall	for	dinner	at	the	'Varsity.	The	comparison	was	very	close.	First-year men—that	is	to	say,	junior	officers	returning	from	their	first	leave—were	the most	encumbered,	self-possessed,	and	asserting;	those	of	the	second	year,	so	to say,	usually	got	a	corner-seat	and	looked	out	of	window;	while	here	and	there	a senior	officer,	or	a	subaltern	with	a	senior's	face,	selected	a	place,	arranged	his few	possessions,	and	got	out	a	paper,	not	in	the	Oxford	manner,	as	if	he	owned the	place,	but	in	the	Cambridge,	as	if	he	didn't	care	a	damn	who	did.

Peter	made	a	horrible	hash	of	it.	He	tried	to	find	a	seat	with	all	his	goods	in	his hands,	not	realising	that	they	might	have	been	deposited	anywhere	in	the	train, and	found	when	it	had	started,	since,	owing	to	a	particular	dispensation	of	the high	gods,	everything	that	passed	the	barrier	for	France	got	there.	He	made	a dive	for	one	place	and	sat	in	it,	never	noting	a	thin	stick	in	the	corner,	and	he cleared	out	with	enormous	apologies	when	a	perfectly	groomed	Major	with	an exceedingly	pleasant	manner	mentioned	that	it	was	his	seat,	and	carefully	put	the stick	elsewhere	as	soon	as	Peter	had	gone.	Finally,	at	the	end	of	a	carriage,	he descried	a	small	door	half	open,	and	inside	what	looked	like	an	empty	seat.	He pulled	it	open,	and	discovered	a	small,	select	compartment	with	a	centre	table and	three	men	about	it,	all	making	themselves	very	comfortable.

"I	beg	your	pardon,"	said	Peter,	"but	is	there	a	place	vacant	for	one?"

The	three	eyed	him	stonily,	and	he	knew	instinctively	that	he	was	again	a	fresher calling	on	the	second	year.	One,	a	Captain,	raised	his	head	to	look	at	him	better.

He	was	a	man	of	light	hair	and	blue,	alert	eyes,	wearing	a	cap	that,	while	not looking	dissipated,	somehow	conveyed	the	impression	that	its	owner	knew	all about	things—a	cap,	too,	that	carried	the	Springbok	device.	The	lean	face,	with its	humorous	mouth,	regarded	Peter	and	took	him	all	in:	his	vast	expanse	of collar,	the	wide	black	edging	to	his	shoulder-straps,	his	brand-new	badges,	his black	buttons	and	stars.	Then	he	lied	remorselessly:

"Sorry,	padre;	we're	full	up."

Peter	backed	out	and	forgot	to	close	the	door,	for	at	that	moment	a	shrill	whistle was	excruciatingly	blown.	He	found	himself	in	the	very	cab	of	the	Pullman	with the	glass	door	before	him,	through	which	could	be	seen	a	sudden	bustle.

Subalterns	hastened	forward	from	the	more	or	less	secluded	spots	that	they	had

found,	with	a	vision	of	skirts	and	hats	behind	them;	an	inspector	passed aggressively	along;	and—thanks	to	those	high	gods—Peter	observed	the hurrying	hotel	porter	at	that	moment.	In	sixty	seconds	the	door	had	been	jerked open;	a	gladstone,	a	suit-case,	and	a	kit-bag	shot	at	him;	largesse	had	changed hands;	the	door	had	shut	again;	the	train	had	groaned	and	started;	and	Peter	was off	to	France.

It	was	with	mixed	feelings	that	he	groped	for	his	luggage.	He	was	conscious	of wanting	a	seat	and	a	breakfast;	he	was	also	conscious	of	wanting	to	look	at	the station	he	was	leaving,	which	he	dimly	felt	he	might	never	see	again;	and	he was,	above	all,	conscious	that	he	looked	a	fool	and	would	like	not	to.	In	such	a turmoil	he	lugged	at	the	gladstone	and	got	it	into	a	corner,	and	then	turned	to	the window	in	the	cleared	space	with	a	determination.	In	turning	he	caught	the Captain's	face	stuck	round	the	little	door.	It	was	withdrawn	at	once,	but	came	out again,	and	he	heard	for	the	second	time	the	unfamiliar	title:

"Say,	padre;	come	in	here.	There's	room	after	all."

Peter	felt	cheered.	He	staggered	to	the	door,	and	found	the	others	busy	making room.	A	subaltern	of	the	A.S.C.	gripped	his	small	attaché	case	and	swung	it	up on	to	the	rack.	The	South	African	pulled	a	British	warm	off	the	vacant	seat	and reached	out	for	the	suit-case.	And	the	third	man,	with	the	rank	of	a	Major	and	the badge	of	a	bursting	bomb,	struck	a	match	and	paused	as	he	lit	a	cigarette	to	jerk out:

"Damned	full	train!	We	ought	to	have	missed	it,	Donovan."

"It's	a	good	stunt	that,	if	too	many	blighters	don't	try	it	on,"	observed	the subaltern,	reaching	for	Peter's	warm.	"But	they	did	my	last	leave,	and	I	got	the devil	of	a	choking	off	from	the	brass-hat	in	charge.	It's	the	Staff	train,	and	they only	take	Prime	Ministers,	journalists,	and	trade-union	officials	in	addition.

How's	that,	padre?"

"Thanks,"	said	Peter,	subsiding.	"It's	jolly	good	of	you	to	take	me	in.	I	thought I'd	got	to	stand	from	here	to	Folkestone."

H.P.	Jenks,	Second-Lieutenant	A.S.C.,	regarded	him	seriously.	"It	couldn't	be done,	padre,"	he	said,	"not	at	this	hour	of	the	morning.	I	left	Ealing	about midnight	more	or	less,	got	sandwiched	in	the	Metro	with	a	Brigadier-General and	his	blooming	wife	and	daughters,	and	had	to	wait	God	knows	how	long	for

the	R.T.O.	If	I	couldn't	get	a	seat	and	a	break	after	that,	I'd	be	a	casualty,	sure thing."

"It's	your	own	fault	for	going	home	last	night,"	observed	the	Major	judiciously.

(Peter	noticed	that	he	was	little	older	than	Jenks	on	inspection.)	"Gad,	Donovan, you	should	have	been	with	us	at	the	Adelphi!	It	was	some	do,	I	can	tell	you.	And afterwards…"

"Shut	up,	Major!"	cut	in	Jenks.	"Remember	the	padre."

"Oh,	he's	broad-minded	I	know,	aren't	you,	padre?	By	the	way,	did	you	ever meet	old	Drennan	who	was	up	near	Poperinghe	with	the	Canadians?	He	was	a sport,	I	can	tell	you.	Mind	you,	a	real	good	chap	at	his	job,	but	a	white	man.

Pluck!	By	jove!	I	don't	think	that	chap	had	nerves.	I	saw	him	one	day	when	they were	dropping	heavy	stuff	on	the	station,	and	he	was	getting	some	casualties	out of	a	Red	Cross	train.	A	shell	burst	just	down	the	embankment,	and	his	two orderlies	ducked	for	it	under	the	carriage,	but	old	Drennan	never	turned	a	hair.

'Better	have	a	fag,'	he	said	to	the	Scottie	he	was	helping.	'It's	no	use	letting	Fritz put	one	off	one's	smoke.'"

Peter	said	he	had	not	met	him,	but	could	not	think	of	anything	else	to	say	at	the moment,	except	that	he	was	just	going	out	for	the	first	time.

"You	don't	say?"	said	Donovan	dryly.

"Wish	I	was!"	ejaculated	Jenks.

"Good	chap,"	replied	the	Major.	"Pity	more	of	your	sort	don't	come	over.	When	I was	up	at	Loos,	September	last	year,	we	didn't	see	a	padre	in	three	months.	Then they	put	on	a	little	chap—forget	his	name—who	used	to	bike	over	when	we	were in	rest	billets.	But	he	wasn't	much	use."

"I	was	in	hospital	seven	weeks	and	never	saw	one,"	said	Jenks.

"Good	heavens!"	said	Graham.	"But	I've	been	trying	to	get	out	for	all	these years,	and	I	was	always	told	that	every	billet	was	taken	and	that	there	were hundreds	on	the	waiting	list.	Last	December	the	Chaplain-General	himself showed	me	a	list	of	over	two	hundred	names."

"Don't	know	where	they	get	to,	then,	do	you,	Bevan?"	asked	Jenks.

"No,"	said	the	Major,	"unless	they	keep	'em	at	the	base."

"Plenty	down	at	Rouen,	anyway,"	said	Donovan.	"A	sporting	little	blighter I	met	at	the	Brasserie	Opera	told	me	he	hadn't	anything	to	do,	anyway."

"I	shall	be	a	padre	in	the	next	war,"	said	Jenks,	stretching	out	his	legs.	"A	parade on	Sunday,	and	you're	finished	for	the	week.	No	orderly	dog,	no	night	work,	and plenty	of	time	for	your	meals.	Padres	can	always	get	leave	too,	and	they	always come	and	go	by	Paris."

Donovan	laughed,	and	glanced	sideways	at	Peter.	"Stow	it,	Jenks,"	he	said.

"Where	you	for,	padre?"	he	asked.

"I've	got	to	report	at	Rouen,"	said	Peter.	"I	was	wondering	if	you	were	there."

"No	such	luck	now,"	returned	the	other.	"But	it's	a	jolly	place.	Jenko's	there.	Get him	to	take	you	out	to	Duclair.	You	can	get	roast	duck	at	a	pub	there	that	melts	in your	mouth.	And	what's	that	little	hotel	near	the	statue	of	Joan	of	Arc,	Jenks, where	they	still	have	decent	wine?"

Peter	was	not	to	learn	yet	awhile,	for	at	that	moment	the	little	door	opened	and	a waiter	looked	in.	"Breakfast,	gentlemen?"	he	asked.

"Oh,	no,"	said	Jenks.	"Waiter,	I	always	bring	some	rations	with	me;	I'll	just	take a	cup	of	coffee."

The	man	grinned.	"Right-o,	sir,"	he	said.	"Porridge,	gentlemen?"

He	disappeared,	leaving	the	door	open	and,	Donovan	opening	a	newspaper, Graham	stared	out	of	window	to	wait.	From	the	far	corners	came	scraps	of conversation,	from	which	he	gathered	that	Jenks	and	the	Major	were	going	over the	doings	of	the	night	before.	He	caught	a	word	or	two,	and	stared	the	harder out	of	window.

Outside	the	English	country	was	rushing	by.	Little	villas,	with	back-gardens running	down	to	the	rail,	would	give	way	for	a	mile	or	two	to	fields,	and	then start	afresh.	The	fog	was	thin	there,	and	England	looked	extraordinarily	homely and	pleasant.	It	was	the	known;	he	was	conscious	of	rushing	at	fifty	miles	an hour	into	the	unknown.	He	turned	over	the	scrappy	conversation	of	the	last	few minutes,	and	found	it	savoured	of	the	unknown.	It	was	curious	the	difference

uniform	made.	He	felt	that	these	men	were	treating	him	more	like	one	of themselves	than	men	in	a	railway-carriage	had	ever	treated	him	before;	that somehow	even	his	badges	made	him	welcome;	and	yet	that,	nevertheless,	it	was not	he,	Peter	Graham,	that	they	welcomed,	or	at	least	not	his	type.	He	wondered if	padres	in	France	were	different	from	priests	in	England.	He	turned	over	the unknown	Drennan	in	his	mind.	Was	it	because	he	was	a	good	priest	that	the	men liked	him,	or	because	they	had	discovered	the	man	in	the	parson?

The	waiter	brought	in	the	breakfast—porridge,	fish,	toast,	and	the	rest—and	they fell	to,	a	running	fire	of	comments	going	on	all	the	time.	Donovan	had	had Japanese	marmalade	somewhere,	and	thought	it	better	than	this.	The	Major wouldn't	touch	the	beastly	margarine,	but	Jenks	thought	it	quite	as	good	as	butter if	taken	with	marmalade,	and	put	it	on	nearly	as	thickly	as	his	toast.	Peter expanded	in	the	air	of	camaraderie,	and	when	he	leaned	back	with	a	cigarette, tunic	unbuttoned	and	cap	tossed	up	on	the	rack,	he	felt	as	if	he	had	been	in	the Army	for	years.	He	reflected	how	curious	that	was.	The	last	two	or	three	years	or so	of	Boy	Scouts	and	hospitals	and	extra	prayer-meetings,	attended	by	the	people who	attended	everything	else,	seemed	to	have	faded	away.	There	was	hardly	a gap	between	that	first	war	evening	which	he	remembered	so	clearly	and	this.	It was	a	common	experience	enough,	and	probably	due	to	the	fact	that,	whereas everything	else	had	made	little	impression,	he	had	lived	for	this	moment	and been	extraordinarily	impressed	by	that	Sunday.	But	he	realised,	also,	that	it	was due	as	much	to	his	present	companions.	They	had,	seemingly,	accepted	him	as he	had	never	been	accepted	before.	They	asked	practically	no	questions.	So	far as	he	could	see,	he	made	no	difference	to	them.	He	felt	as	if	he	were	at	last	part of	a	great	brotherhood,	in	which,	chiefly,	one	worried	about	nothing	more important	than	Japanese	marmalade	and	margarine.

"We're	almost	there,	boys,"	said	Bevan,	peering	out	of	window.

"Curse!"	ejaculated	Jenks.	"I	hate	getting	my	traps	together	in	a	train,	and	I loathe	the	mob	on	the	boat."

"I	don't	see	why	you	should,"	said	Donovan.	"I'm	blest	if	I	bother	about anything.	The	R.T.O.	and	the	red-caps	do	everything,	and	you	needn't	even worry	about	getting	a	Pullman	ticket	this	way	over.	Hope	it's	not	rough,	though."

He	let	a	window	down	and	leaned	out.	"Looks	all	right,"	he	added.

Peter	got	up	with	the	rest	and	began	to	hang	things	about	him.	His	staringly	new

Sam	Browne	irritated	him,	but	he	forgot	it	as	the	train	swung	round	the	curve	to the	landing-stage.

"Get	a	porter	and	a	truck,	Donovan,"	said	the	Major,	who	was	farthest	from	the door.

They	got	out	nonchalantly,	and	Peter	lit	a	cigarette,	while	the	others	threw remarks	at	the	man	as	to	luggage.	Then	they	all	trooped	off	together	in	a	crowd that	consisted	of	every	variety	of	rank	and	regiment	and	section	of	the	British Empire,	plus	some	Waacs	and	nurses.

The	Pride	of	Folkestone	lay	alongside,	and	when	they	got	there	she	seemed already	full.	The	four	of	them	got	jammed	at	the	gangway	and	shoved	on	board, handing	in	and	receiving	papers	from	the	official	at	the	head	as	they	passed	him.

Donovan	was	in	front,	and	as	he	stepped	on	deck	he	swung	his	kit-bag	back	to Peter,	crying:

"Lay	hold	of	that,	padre,	and	edge	across	the	deck.	Get	up	ahead	of	the	funnel that	side.	I'll	get	chairs.	Jenko,	you	rotter,	get	belts,	and	drop	eyeing	the	girl!"

"Jolly	nice	bit	of	fluff,"	said	Jenks	meditatively,	staring	fixedly	across	the	deck.

"Where?"	queried	the	Major,	fumbling	for	his	eyeglass.

"Get	on	there,	please,	gentlemen,"	called	a	ship's	official.

"Damn	it!	mind	my	leg!"

"Cheerio,	old	son,	here	we	are	again!"

"I	say,	Tommy,	did	you	get	to	the	Alhambra	last	night,	after	all?	What?

Well,	I	couldn't	see	you,	anyhow."

To	which	accompaniment,	Peter	pushed	his	way	across	the	deck.	"Sorry,	padre,"

said	a	V.A.D.	who	blocked	the	way,	bending	herself	back	to	let	him	pass,	and smiling.	"Catch	hold,"	called	out	Donovan,	swinging	a	couple	of	chairs	at	him.

"No,	sir,	it's	not	my	chair"—to	a	Colonel	who	was	grabbing	at	one	already	set out	against	the	rail.

The	Colonel	collected	it	and	disappeared,	Jenks	appearing	a	moment	later,	red-

faced,	through	the	crush.	"You	blamed	fool,"	he	whispered,	"it's	that	girl's.	I	saw her	put	one	here	and	edged	up	on	it,	only	some	fool	got	in	my	way.	Still (hopefully),	perhaps	she'll	come	back."

Between	them	they	got	four	chairs	into	a	line	and	sat	down,	all,	that	is,	save Jenks,	who	stood	up,	in	a	bland	and	genial	way,	as	if	to	survey	the	crowd impartially.	How	impartially	soon	appeared.	"Damn!"	he	exploded.	"She's	met some	other	females,	weird	and	woolly	things,	and	she's	sitting	down	there.	No, by	Jove!	she's	looking	this	way."

He	made	a	half-start	forward,	and	the	Major	kicked	his	shins.	"Blast!"	he exploded;	"why	did	you	do	that,	you	fool?"

"Don't	be	an	infant,	Jenko,	sit	down.	You	can't	start	a	flirtation	across	the blooming	deck.	Here,	padre,	can't	you	keep	him	in	order?"

Peter	half	raised	himself	from	his	chair	at	this,	and	glanced	the	way	the	other was	looking.	Through	the	crush	he	saw,	clearly	enough	for	a	minute,	a	girl	of medium	height	in	a	nurse's	uniform,	sideways	on	to	him.	The	next	second	she half-turned,	obviously	smiling	some	remark	to	her	neighbour,	and	he	caught sight	of	clear	brown	eyes	and	a	little	fringe	of	dark	hair	on	the	forehead	of	an almost	childish	face.	The	eyes	met	his.	And	then	a	sailor	blundered	across	his field	of	vision.

"Topping,	isn't	she?"	demanded	Jenks,	who	had	apparently	been	pulled	down into	his	chair	in	the	interval.

"Oh,	I	don't	know,"	said	Graham,	and	added	deliberately:	"Rather	ordinary,	I thought."

Jenks	stared	at	him.	"Good	Lord,	padre,"	he	said,	"where	are	your	eyes?"

Peter	heard	a	little	chuckle	behind,	and	glanced	round	to	see	Donovan	staring	at him	with	amusement	written	all	across	his	face.	"You'll	do,	padre,"	he	said, taking	a	pipe	from	his	pocket	and	beginning	to	fill	it.	Peter	smiled	and	leant back.	Probably	for	the	first	time	in	five	years	he	forgot	for	a	moment	what	sort	of a	collar	it	was	around	his	neck.

Sitting	there,	he	began	to	enjoy	himself.	The	sea	glittered	in	the	sun	and	the	Lees stretched	out	opposite	him	across	the	shining	gulf.	Sea-birds	dipped	and

screamed.	On	his	left,	Major	Bevan	was	talking	to	a	flying	man,	and	Peter glanced	up	with	him	to	see	an	aeroplane	that	came	humming	high	up	above	the trees	on	the	cliff	and	flew	out	to	sea.

"Damned	fine	type!"	said	the	boy,	whose	tunic,	for	all	his	youth,	sported	wings.

"Fritz	can't	touch	it	yet.	Of	course,	he'll	copy	it	soon	enough,	or	go	one	better, but	just	at	present	I	think	it's	the	best	out.	Wish	we'd	got	some	in	our	circus.

We've	nothing	but	…"	and	he	trailed	off	into	technicalities.

Peter	found	himself	studying	Donovan,	who	lay	back	beyond	Jenks	turning	the pages	of	an	illustrated	magazine	and	smoking.	The	eyes	interested	him;	they looked	extraordinarily	clear,	but	as	if	their	owner	kept	hidden	behind	them	a	vast number	of	secrets	as	old	as	the	universe.	The	face	was	lined—good-looking,	he thought,	but	the	face	of	a	man	who	was	no	novice	in	the	school	of	life.	Peter	felt he	liked	the	Captain	instinctively.	He	carried	breeding	stamped	on	him,	far	more than,	say,	the	Major	with	the	eyeglass.	Peter	wondered	if	they	would	meet	again.

The	siren	sounded,	and	a	bustle	began	as	people	put	on	their	life-belts.	"All	life-belts	on,	please,"	said	a	young	officer	continually,	who,	with	a	brassard	on	his arm,	was	going	up	and	down	among	the	chairs.	"Who's	that?"	asked	Peter, struggling	with	his	belt.

"Some	poor	bloke	who	has	been	roped	in	for	crossin'	duty,"	said	Jenks.	"Mind my	chair,	padre;	Bevan	and	I	are	going	below	for	a	wet.	Coming,	skipper?"

"Not	yet,"	said	Donovan;	"the	bar's	too	full	at	first	for	me.	Padre	and I'll	come	later."

The	others	stepped	off	across	the	crowded	deck,	and	Donovan	pitched	his magazine	into	Bevan's	chair	to	retain	it.

"You're	from	South	Africa?"	queried	Peter.

"Yes,"	replied	the	other.	"I	was	in	German	West,	and	came	over	after	on	my	own.

Joined	up	with	the	brigade	here."

"What	part	of	Africa?"	asked	Peter.

"Basutoland,	padre.	Not	a	bad	place	in	a	way—decent	climate,	topping	scenery, but	rather	a	stodgy	crowd	in	the	camps.	One	or	two	decent	people,	but	the

majority	mid-Victorian,	without	a	blessed	notion	except	the	price	of	mealies, who	quarrel	about	nothing	half	the	time,	and	talk	tuppenny-ha'penny	scandal	the rest.	Good	Lord!	I	wish	we	had	some	of	the	perishers	out	here.	But	they	know which	side	of	the	bread	the	butter	is.	Bad	time	for	trade,	they	say,	and	every other	trader	has	bought	a	car	since	the	war.	Of	course,	there's	something	to	be said	for	the	other	side,	but	what	gets	my	goat	is	their	pettiness.	I'm	for	British East	Africa	after	the	war.	There's	a	chap	written	a	novel	about	Basutoland	called

'The	Land	of	To-morrow,'	but	I'd	call	it	'The	Land	of	the	Day	before	Yesterday.'	I suppose	some	of	them	came	over	with	an	assortment	of	ideas	one	time,	but they've	struck	no	new	ones	since.	I	don't	advise	you	to	settle	in	a	South	African dorp	if	you	can	help	it,	padre."

"Don't	suppose	I	shall,"	said	Peter.	"I've	just	got	engaged,	and	my	girl's	people wouldn't	let	her	out	of	England."

"Engaged,	are	you?	Thank	your	stars	you	aren't	married.	It's	safer	not	to	be	out here."

"Why?"

Donovan	looked	at	him	curiously.	"Oh,	you'll	find	out	fast	enough,	padre,"	he said.	"Wonder	what	you'll	make	of	it.	Rum	place	just	now,	France,	I	can	tell	you.

There's	the	sweepings	of	half	the	world	over	there,	and	everything's	turned upside	down.	Fellows	are	out	for	a	spree,	of	course,	and	you	can't	be	hard	on	a chap	down	from	the	line	if	he	goes	on	the	bust	a	bit.	It's	human	nature,	and	you must	allow	for	it;	don't	you	think	so?"

"Human	nature	can	be	controlled,"	said	Peter	primly.

"Can	it?"	retorted	the	other.	"Even	the	cloth	doesn't	find	it	too	easy,	apparently."

"What	do	you	mean?"	demanded	Peter,	and	then	added:	"Don't	mind	telling	me; I	really	want	to	know."

Donovan	knocked	out	his	pipe,	and	evaded.	"You've	got	to	be	broad-minded, padre,"	he	said.

"Well,	I	am,"	said	Peter.	"But	…"

"Come	and	have	a	drink	then,"	interrupted	the	other.	"Jenko	and	the	Major	are

coming	back."

"Damned	poor	whisky!"	said	the	latter,	catching	the	rail	as	the	boat	heaved	a	bit,

"begging	your	pardon,	padre.	Better	try	brandy.	If	the	war	lasts	much	longer there'll	be	no	whisky	worth	drinking	this	side.	I'm	off	it	till	we	get	to	the	club	at Boulogne."

Peter	and	Donovan	went	off	together.	It	was	a	new	experience	for	Peter,	but	he wouldn't	have	owned	it.	They	groped	their	way	down	the	saloon	stairs,	and through	a	crowd	to	the	little	bar.	"What's	yours?"	demanded	Donovan.

"Oh,	I'll	take	the	Major's	advice,"	said	Peter.	"Brandy-and-soda	for	me."

"Soda	finished,	sir,"	said	the	bar	steward.

"All	right:	two	brandies-and-water,	steward,"	said	Donovan,	and	swung	a revolving	seat	near	round	for	Graham.	As	he	took	it,	Peter	noticed	the	man opposite.	His	badge	was	a	Maltese	Cross,	but	he	wore	a	flannel	collar	and	tie.

Their	eyes	met,	but	the	other	stared	a	bit	stonily.	For	the	second	time,	Peter wished	he	hadn't	a	clerical	collar.	The	next	he	was	taking	the	glass	from	the South	African.	"Cheerio,"	said	Donovan.

"Here's	to	you,"	said	Peter,	and	leaned	back	with	an	assumption	of	ease.

He	had	a	strange	sense	of	unreality.	No	fool	and	no	Puritan,	he	had	naturally, however,	been	little	in	such	an	atmosphere	since	ordination.	He	would	have	had a	drink	in	Park	Lane	with	the	utmost	ease,	and	he	would	have	argued,	over	it, that	the	clergy	were	not	nearly	so	out	of	touch	with	men	as	the	papers	said.	But down	here,	in	the	steamer's	saloon,	surrounded	by	officers,	in	an	atmosphere	of indifference	to	him	and	his	office,	he	felt	differently.	He	was	aware,	dimly,	that for	the	past	five	years	situations	in	which	he	had	been	had	been	dominated	by him,	and	that	he,	as	a	clergyman,	had	been	continually	the	centre	of	concern.

Talk,	conduct,	and	company	had	been	rearranged	when	he	came	in,	and	it	had happened	so	often	that	he	had	ceased	to	be	aware	of	it.	But	now	he	was	a	mere unit,	of	no	particular	importance	whatever.	No	one	dreamed	of	modifying himself	particularly	because	a	clergyman	was	present.	Peter	clung	to	the	belief that	it	was	not	altogether	so,	but	he	was	sufficiently	conscious	of	it.	And	he	was conscious	of	liking	it,	of	wanting	to	sink	back	in	it	as	a	man	sinks	back	in	an easy-chair.	He	felt	he	ought	not	to	do	so,	and	he	made	a	kind	of	mental	effort	to pull	himself	together.

Up	on	the	deck	the	world	was	very	fair.	The	French	coast	was	now	clearly visible,	and	even	the	houses	of	the	town,	huddled	together	as	it	seemed,	but dominated	by	a	church	on	the	hill.	Behind	them,	a	sister	ship	containing Tommies	ploughed	steadily	along,	serene	and	graceful	in	the	sunlight,	and	above an	airship	of	silvery	aluminum,	bearing	the	tricoloured	circle	of	the	Allies,	kept pace	with	the	swift	ship	without	an	effort.	Four	destroyers	were	visible,	their low,	dark	shapes	ploughing	regularly	along	at	stated	intervals,	and	someone	said a	fifth	was	out	of	sight	behind.	People	were	already	beginning	to	take	off	their life-belts,	and	the	sailors	were	clearing	a	place	for	the	gangway.	Peter	found	that Donovan	had	known	what	he	was	about,	for	his	party	would	be	close	to	the gangway	without	moving.	He	began	to	wonder	uneasily	what	would	be	done	on landing,	and	to	hope	that	Donovan	would	be	going	his	way.	No	one	had	said	a word	about	it.	He	looked	round	for	Jenks'	nurse,	but	couldn't	see	her.

It	was	jolly	entering	the	port.	The	French	houses	and	fishing-boats	looked foreign,	although	one	could	hardly	say	why.	On	the	quay	was	a	big	notice:	"All officers	to	report	at	once	to	the	M.L.O."	Farther	on	was	a	board	bearing	the letters	"R.T.O."	…	But	Peter	hardly	liked	to	ask.

In	fact,	everything	went	like	clockwork.	He	presently	found	himself	in	a	queue, behind	Donovan,	of	officers	who	were	passing	a	small	window	like	a	ticket office.	Arriving,	he	handed	in	papers,	and	was	given	them	back	with	a	brief	"All right."	Beyond,	Donovan	had	secured	a	broken-down-looking	one-horse	cab.

"You'll	be	coming	to	the	club,	padre?"	he	asked.	"Chuck	in	your	stuff.	This chap'll	take	it	down	and	Bevan	with	it.	Let's	walk.	It	isn't	far."

Jenks	elected	to	go	with	his	friend	the	Major,	and	Donovan	and	Peter	set	off	over the	cobbles.	They	joined	up	with	another	small	group,	and	for	the	first	time	Peter had	to	give	his	name	as	he	was	introduced.	He	forgot	the	others,	as	soon	as	he heard	them,	and	they	forgot	his.	A	big	Dublin	Fusilier	officer	with	a	tiny moustache,	that	seemed	ludicrous	in	his	great	face,	exchanged	a	few	sentences with	him.	They	left	the	quay	and	crossed	a	wide	space	where	a	bridge	debouched towards	the	railway-station.	Donovan,	who	was	walking	ahead,	passed	on,	but the	Fusilier	suggested	to	Peter	that	they	might	as	well	see	the	R.T.O.	at	once about	trains.	Entering	the	station	gates,	the	now	familiar	initials	appearing	on	a row	of	offices	before	them	to	the	left,	Peter's	companion	demanded	the	train	to Albert.

"Two-thirty	a.m.,	change	at	Amiens,	sir,"	said	a	clerk	in	uniform	within,	and	the

Fusilier	passed	on.

"What	time	is	the	Rouen	train?"	asked	Peter	in	his	turn,	and	was	told	9.30	p.m.

"You're	in	luck,	padre,"	said	the	other.	"It's	bally	rotten	getting	in	at	two-thirty, and	probably	the	beastly	thing	won't	go	till	five.	Still,	it	might	be	worse.	You	can get	on	board	at	midnight,	and	with	luck	get	to	sleep.	If	I	were	you,	I'd	be	down here	early	for	yours—crowded	always,	it	is.	Of	course,	you'll	dine	at	the	club?"

Peter	supposed	he	would.

The	club	entrance	was	full	up	with	officers,	and	more	and	more	kept	pouring	in.

Donovan	was	just	leaving	the	counter	on	the	right	with	some	tickets	in	his	hand as	they	pushed	in.	"See	you	later,"	he	called	out.	"I've	got	to	sleep	here,	and	I want	to	leave	my	traps."

Peter	wondered	where,	but	was	too	much	occupied	in	keeping	well	behind	the Fusilier	to	think	much.	At	a	kind	of	counter	a	girl	in	a	W.A.A.C.	uniform	was serving	out	tickets	of	one	sort	and	another,	and	presently	the	two	of	them	were before	her.	For	a	few	francs	one	got	tickets	for	lunch,	dinner,	bed,	a	bath,	and whatever	else	one	wanted,	but	Peter	had	no	French	money.	The	Fusilier	bought him	the	first	two,	however,	and	together	they	forced	their	way	out	into	the	great lounge.	"Half	an	hour	before	lunch,"	said	his	new	companion,	and	then,	catching sight	of	someone:	"Hullo,	Jack,	you	back?	Never	saw	you	on	the	boat.	Did	you

…"	His	voice	trailed	off	as	he	crossed	the	room.

Peter	looked	around	a	little	disconsolately.	Then	he	made	his	way	to	a	huge lounge-chair	and	threw	himself	into	it.

All	about	him	was	a	subdued	chatter.	A	big	fire	burned	in	the	stove,	and	round	it was	a	wide	semicircle	of	chairs.	Against	the	wall	were	more,	and	a	small	table	or two	stood	about.	Nearly	every	chair	had	its	occupant—all	sorts	and	conditions	of officers,	mostly	in	undress,	and	he	noticed	some	fast	asleep,	with	muddied	boots.

There	was	a	look	on	their	faces,	even	in	sleep,	and	Peter	guessed	that	some	at least	were	down	from	the	line	on	their	way	to	a	brief	leave.	More	and	more	came in	continuously.	Stewards	with	drinks	passed	quickly	in	and	out	about	them.	The Fusilier	and	his	friend	were	just	ordering	something.	Peter	opened	his	case	and took	out	a	cigarette,	tapping	it	carefully	before	lighting	it.	He	began	to	feel	at home	and	lazy	and	comfortable,	as	if	he	had	been	there	before.

An	orderly	entered	with	envelopes	in	his	hand.	"Lieutenant	Frazer?"	he	called, and	looked	round	inquiringly.	There	was	no	reply,	and	he	turned	to	the	next.

"Captain	Saunders?"	Still	no	reply.	"Lieutenant	Morcombe?"	Still	no	reply.

"Lieutenant	Morcombe,"	he	called	again.	Nobody	took	any	interest,	and	he turned	on	his	heel,	pushed	the	swing-door	open,	and	departed.

Then	Donovan	came	in,	closely	followed	by	Bevan.	Peter	got	up	and	made towards	them.	"Hullo!"	said	Bevan.	"Have	an	appetiser,	padre.	Lunch	will	be	on in	twenty	minutes.	What's	yours,	skipper?"

The	three	of	them	moved	on	to	Peter's	chair,	and	Bevan	dragged	up	another.

Peter	subsided,	and	Donovan	sat	on	the	edge.	Peter	pulled	out	his	cigarette-case again,	and	offered	it.	Bevan,	after	one	or	two	ineffectual	attempts,	got	an	orderly at	last.

"Well,	here's	fun,"	he	said.

"Cheerio,"	said	Peter.	He	remembered	Donovan	had	said	that	in	the	saloon.





CHAPTER	III

Jenks	being	attached	to	the	A.S.C.	engaged	in	feeding	daily	more	than	100,000

men	in	the	Rouen	area,	Peter	and	he	travelled	together.	By	the	latter's	advice	they reached	the	railway-station	soon	after	8.30,	but	even	so	the	train	seemed	full.

There	were	no	lights	in	the	siding,	and	none	whatever	on	the	train,	so	that	it	was only	by	matches	that	one	could	tell	if	a	compartment	was	full	or	empty,	except	in the	case	of	those	from	which	candle-light	and	much	noise	proclaimed	the	former indisputably.	At	last,	however,	somewhere	up	near	the	engine,	they	found	a second-class	carriage,	apparently	unoccupied,	with	a	big	ticket	marked

"Reserved"	upon	it.	Jenks	struck	a	match	and	regarded	this	critically.	"Well, padre,"	he	said,	"as	it	doesn't	say	for	whom	it	is	reserved,	I	guess	it	may	as	well be	reserved	for	us.	So	here	goes."	He	swung	up	and	tugged	at	the	door,	which	for some	time	refused	to	give.	Then	it	opened	suddenly,	and	Second-Lieutenant Jenks,	A.S.C.,	subsided	gracefully	and	luridly	on	the	ground	outside.	Peter struck	another	match	and	peered	in.	It	was	then	observed	that	the	compartment was	not	empty,	but	that	a	dark-haired,	lanky	youth,	stretched	completely	along one	seat,	was	regarding	them	solemnly.

"This	carriage	is	reserved,"	he	said.

"Yes,"	said	Jenks	cheerfully,	"for	us,	sir.	May	I	ask	what	you	are	doing	in	it?"

The	awakened	one	sighed.	"It's	worked	before,	and	if	you	chaps	come	in	and shut	the	door	quickly,	perhaps	it	will	work	again.	Three's	not	too	bad,	but	I've seen	six	in	these	perishing	cars.	Come	in	quickly,	for	the	Lord's	sake!"

Peter	looked	round	him	curiously.	Two	of	the	four	windows	were	broken,	and the	glory	had	departed	from	the	upholstery.	There	was	no	light,	and	it	would appear	that	a	heavier	body	than	that	designed	for	it	had	travelled	upon	the	rack.

Jenks	was	swearing	away	to	himself	and	trying	to	light	a	candle-end.	Peter laughed.

"Got	any	cards?"	asked	the	original	owner.

"Yes,"	said	Jenks.	"Got	any	grub?"

"Bath-olivers	and	chocolate	and	half	a	water-bottle	of	whisky,"	replied	the original	owner.	"And	we	shall	need	them."

"Good	enough,"	said	Jenks.	"And	the	padre	here	has	plenty	of	sandwiches,	for	he ordered	a	double	lot."

"Do	you	play	auction,	padre?"	queried	what	turned	out,	in	the	candle-light,	to	be a	Canadian.

Peter	assented;	he	was	moderately	good,	he	knew.

This	fairly	roused	the	Canadian.	He	swung	his	legs	off	the	seat,	and	groped	for the	door.	"Hang	on	to	this	dug-out,	you	men,"	he	said,	"and	I'll	get	a	fourth.	I kidded	some	fellows	of	ours	with	that	notice	just	now,	but	I	know	them,	and	I can	get	a	decent	chap	to	come	in."

He	was	gone	a	few	minutes	only;	then	voices	sounded	outside.	"Been	looking for	you,	old	dear,"	said	their	friend.	"Only	two	sportsmen	here	and	a	nice	little show	all	to	ourselves.	Tumble	in,	and	we'll	get	cheerful.	Not	that	seat,	old	dear.

But	wait	a	jiffy;	let's	sort	things	out	first."

*	*	*	*	*

They	snorted	out	of	the	dreary	tunnel	into	Rouen	in	the	first	daylight	of	the	next morning.	Peter	looked	eagerly	at	the	great	winding	river	and	the	glory	of	the cathedral	as	it	towered	up	above	the	mists	that	hung	over	the	houses.	There	was a	fresh	taste	of	spring	in	the	air,	and	the	smoke	curled	clear	and	blue	from	the slow-moving	barges	on	the	water.	The	bare	trees	on	the	island	showed	every twig	and	thin	branch,	as	if	they	had	been	pencilled	against	the	leaden-coloured flood	beneath.	A	tug	puffed	fussily	upstream,	red	and	yellow	markings	on	its grimy	black.

Jenks	was	asleep	in	the	corner,	but	he	woke	as	they	clattered	across	the	bridge.

"Heigh-ho!"	he	sighed,	stretching.	"Back	to	the	old	graft	again."

Yet	once	more	Peter	began	to	collect	his	belongings.	It	seemed	ages	since	he	had

got	into	the	train	at	Victoria,	and	he	felt	particularly	grubby	and	unshaven.

"What's	the	next	move?"	he	asked.

Jenks	eyed	him.	"Going	to	take	a	taxi?"	he	queried.

"Where	to?"	said	Peter.

"Well,	if	you	ask	me,	padre,"	he	replied,	"I	don't	see	what's	against	a	decent clean-up	and	breakfast	at	the	club.	It	doesn't	much	matter	when	I	report,	and	the club's	handy	for	your	show.	I	know	the	A.C.G.'s	office,	because	it's	in	the	same house	as	the	Base	Cashier,	and	the	club's	just	at	the	bottom	of	the	street.	But	it's the	deuce	of	a	way	from	the	station.	If	we	can	get	a	taxi,	I	vote	we	take	it."

"Right-o,"	agreed	Peter.	"You	lead	on."

They	tumbled	out	on	the	platform,	and	produced	the	necessary	papers	at	the	exit labelled	"British	Officers	Only."	A	red-capped	military	policeman	wrote	down particulars	on	a	paper,	and	in	a	few	minutes	they	were	out	among	the	crowd	of peasantry	in	the	booking-hall.	Jenks	pushed	through,	and	had	secured	a	cab	by the	time	Peter	arrived.	"There	isn't	a	taxi	to	be	got,	padre,"	he	said,	"but	this'll do."

They	rolled	off	down	an	avenue	of	wintry	trees,	passed	a	wooden	building	which Peter	was	informed	was	the	English	military	church,	and	out	on	to	the	stone-paved	quay.	To	Peter	the	drive	was	an	intense	delight.	A	French	blue-coated regiment	swung	past	them.	"Going	up	the	line,"	said	Jenks.	A	crowd	of	black troops	marched	by	in	the	opposite	direction.	"Good	Lord!"	said	Jenks,	"so	the S.A.	native	labour	has	come."	The	river	was	full	of	craft,	but	his	mentor explained	that	the	true	docks	stretched	mile	on	mile	downstream.	By	a	wide bridge	lay	a	camouflaged	steamer.	"Hospital	ship,"	said	Jenks.	Up	a	narrow street	could	be	seen	the	buttresses	of	the	cathedral;	and	if	Peter	craned	his	head to	glance	up,	his	companion	was	more	occupied	in	the	great	café	at	the	corner	a little	farther	on.	But	it	was,	of	course,	deserted	at	that	early	hour.	A	flower-stall at	the	corner	was	gay	with	flowers,	and	two	French	peasant	women	were arranging	the	blooms.	And	then	the	fiacre	swung	into	the	Rue	Joanne	d'Arc,	and opposite	a	gloomy-looking	entrance	pulled	up	with	a	jerk.	"Here	we	are,"	said Jenks.	"It's	up	an	infernal	flight	of	steps."

The	officers'	club	in	Rouen	was	not	monstrously	attractive,	but	they	got	a	good

wash	in	a	little	room	that	looked	out	over	a	tangle	of	picturesque	roofs,	and finally	some	excellent	coffee	and	bacon	and	eggs.

Jenks	lit	a	cigarette	and	handed	one	to	Peter.	"Better	leave	your	traps,"	he	said.

"I'll	go	up	with	you;	I've	nothing	to	do."

Outside	the	street	was	filling	with	the	morning	traffic,	and	the	two	walked	up	the slight	hill	to	the	accompaniment	of	a	running	fire	of	comments	and	explanations from	Jenks,	"That's	Cox's—useful	place	for	the	first	half	of	a	month,	but	not much	use	to	me,	anyway,	for	the	second….	You	ought	to	go	to	I	that	shop	and buy	picture	post-cards,	padre;	there's	a	topping	girl	who	sells	'em….	Rue	de	la Grosse	Horloge—you	can	see	the	clock	hanging	over	the	road.	The	street	runs up	to	the	cathedral:	rather	jolly	sometimes,	but	nothing	doing	now….	What's that?	I	don't	know.	Yes,	I	do,	Palais	de	Justice	or	something	of	that	sort.	Pretty old,	I	believe….	In	those	gardens	is	the	picture	gallery;	not	been	in	myself,	but	I believe	they've	got	some	good	stuff….	That's	your	show,	over	there.	Don't	be long;	I'll	hang	about."

Peter	crossed	the	street,	and,	following	directions	ascended	some	wooden	stairs.

A	door	round	the	corner	at	the	top	was	inscribed	"A.C.G.	(C.	of	E.),"	and	he went	up	to	it.	There	he	cogitated:	ought	one	to	knock,	or,	being	in	uniform,	walk straight	in?	He	could	not	think	of	any	reason	why	one	should	not	knock	being	in uniform,	so	he	knocked.

"Come	in,"	said	a	voice.

He	opened	the	door	and	entered.	At	a	desk	before	him	sat	a	rather	elderly	man, clean-shaven,	who	eyed	him	keenly.	On	his	left,	with	his	back	to	him,	was	a	man in	uniform	pattering	away	busily	on	a	typewriter,	and,	for	the	rest,	the	room contained	a	few	chairs,	a	coloured	print	of	the	Light	of	the	World	over	the fireplace,	and	a	torn	map.	Peter	again	hesitated.	He	wondered	what	was	the	rank of	the	officer	in	the	chair,	and	if	he	ought	to	salute.	While	he	hesitated,	the	other said:	"Good-morning.	What	can	I	do	for	you?"

Peter,	horribly	nervous,	made	a	half-effort	at	saluting,	and	stepped	forward.	"My name's	Graham,	sir,"	he	said.	"I've	just	come	over,	and	was	told	in	the	C.G.'s office	in	London	to	report	to	Colonel	Chichester,	A.C.G.,	at	Rouen."

The	other	put	him	at	his	ease	at	once.	He	rose	and	held	a	hand	out	over	the littered	desk.	"How	do	you	do,	Mr.	Graham?"	he	said.	"We	were	expecting	you.	I

am	the	A.C.G.	here,	and	we've	plenty	for	you	to	do.	Take	a	seat,	won't	you?	I believe	I	once	heard	you	preach	at	my	brother's	place	down	in	Suffolk.	You	were at	St.	Thomas's,	weren't	you,	down	by	the	river?"

Peter	warmed	to	the	welcome.	It	was	strangely	familiar,	after	the	past	twenty-four	hours,	to	hear	himself	called	"Mr."	and,	despite	the	uniforms	and	the surroundings,	he	felt	he	might	be	in	the	presence	of	a	vicar	in	England.	Some	of his	old	confidence	began	to	return.	He	replied	freely	to	the	questions.

Presently	the	other	glanced	at	his	watch.	"Well,"	he	said,	"I've	got	to	go	over	to H.Q.,	and	you	had	better	be	getting	to	your	quarters.	Where	did	I	place	Captain Graham,	Martin?"

The	orderly	at	the	desk	leaned	sideways	and	glanced	at	a	paper	pinned	on	the desk.	"No.	5	Rest	Camp,	sir,"	he	said.

"Ah,	yes,	I	remember	now.	You	can	get	a	tram	at	the	bottom	of	the	street	that will	take	you	nearly	all	the	way.	It's	a	pretty	place,	on	the	edge	of	the	country.

You'll	find	about	one	thousand	men	in	camp,	and	the	O.C.'s	name	is—what	is	it, Martin?"

"Captain	Harold,	sir."

"Harold,	that's	it.	A	decent	chap.	The	men	are	constantly	coming	and	going,	but there's	a	good	deal	to	do."

"Is	there	a	chapel	in	the	camp?"	asked	Peter.

"Oh,	no,	I	don't	think	so.	You'll	use	the	canteen.	There's	a	quiet	room	there	you can	borrow	for	celebrations.	There's	a	P.O.W.	camp	next	door	one	way	and	a South	African	Native	Labour	Corps	lot	the	other.	But	they	have	their	own chaplains.	We'll	let	you	down	easy	at	first,	but	you	might	see	if	you	can	fix	up	a service	or	so	for	the	men	in	the	forest.	There's	a	Labour	Company	out	there cutting	wood.	Maybe	you'll	be	able	to	get	a	lift	out	in	a	car,	but	get	your	O.C.	to indent	for	a	bicycle	if	there	isn't	one.	Drop	in	and	see	me	some	day	and	tell	me how	you	are	getting	on,	I'll	find	you	some	more	work	later	on."

Peter	got	up.	The	other	held	out	his	hand,	which	Peter	took,	and	then, remembering	O.T.C.	days	at	Oxford,	firmly	and,	unblushingly	saluted.	The Colonel	made	a	little	motion.	"Good-bye,"	he	said,	and	Peter	found	himself

outside	the	door.

"No.	5	Rest.	Camp;"	said	Jenks	a	moment	later:	"you're	in	luck,	padre.	It's	a topping	camp,	and	the	skipper	is	an	awfully	good	sort.	Beast	of	a	long	way	out, though.	You'll	have	to	have	a	taxi	now."

"The	A.C.G.	said	a	tram	would	do,"	said	Peter.

"Then	he	talked	through	his	blooming	hat,"	replied	the	other.	"He's	probably never	been	there	in	his	little	life.	It's	two	miles	beyond	the	tram	terminus	if	it's	a yard.	My	place	is	just	across	the	river,	and	there's	a	ferry	that	pretty	well	drops you	there.	Tell	you	what	I'll	do.	I'll	see	you	down	and	then	skip	over."

"What	about	your	stuff,	though?"	queried	Peter.

"Oh?	bless	you,	I	can	get	a	lorry	to	collect	that.	That's	one	use	in	being	A.S.C.,	at any	rate."

"It's	jolly	decent	of	you,"	said	Peter.

"Not	a	bit,	old	dear,"	returned	the	other.	"You're	the	right	sort,	padre,	and	I'm	at	a loose	end	just	now.	Besides,	I'd	like	to	see	old	Harold.	He's	one	of	the	best.

Come	on."

They	found	a	taxi	this	time,	near	the	Gare	du	Vert,	and	ran	quickly	out,	first	over cobbles,	then	down	a	wide	avenue	with	a	macadamised	surface	which	paralleled the	river,	downstream.

"Main	road	to	Havre,"	volunteered	Jenks.	"I've	been	through	once	or	twice	with our	stuff.	It's	a	jolly	pretty	run,	and	you	can	lunch	in	Candebec	with	a	bit	of	luck, which	is	one	of	the	beauty-spots	of	the	Seine,	you	know."

The	road	gave	on	open	country	in	a	few	miles,	though	there	were	camps	to	be seen	between	it	and	the	river,	with	wharves	and	buildings	at	intervals,	and	ahead a	biggish	waterside	village.	Just	short	of	that	they	pulled	up.	A	notice-board remarked	"No.	5	Rest	Camp,"	and	Peter	saw	he	had	arrived.

The	sun	was	well	up	by	this	time,	and	his	spirits	with	it.	The	country	smiled	in the	clear	light.	Behind	the	camp	fields	ran	up	to	a	thick	wood	through	which wound	a	road,	and	the	river	was	just	opposite	them.	A	sentry	came	to	attention

as	they	passed	in,	sloped	arms,	and	saluted.	Peter	stared	at	him.	"You	ought	to take	the	salute,	padre,"	said	Jenks;	"you're	senior	to	me,	you	know."

They	passed	down	a	regular	street	of	huts,	most	of	which	had	little	patches	of garden	before	them	in	which	the	green	of	some	early	spring	flowers	was	already showing,	and	stopped	before	the	orderly-room.	Jenks	said	he	would	look	in	and see	if	"the	skipper"	were	inside,	and	in	a	second	or	two	came	out	with	a	red-faced,	cheerful-looking	man,	whom	he	introduced	as	Captain	Harold.	With	them was	a	tall	young	Scots	officer	in	a	kilt,	whom	Peter	learned	was	Lieutenant Mackay	of	their	mess.

"Glad	to	see	you,	padre,"	said	Harold.	"Our	last	man	wasn't	up	to	much,	and Jenks	says	you're	a	sport.	I've	finished	in	there,	so	come	on	to	the	mess	and	let's have	a	spot	for	luck.	Come	on,	Scottie.	Eleven	o'clock's	all	right	for	you,	isn't it?"

"Shan't	say	no,"	said	the	gentleman	addressed,	and	they	passed	behind	the orderly-room	and	in	at	an	open	door.

Peter	glanced	curiously	round.	The	place	was	very	cheerful—a	fire	burning	and gay	pictures	on	the	wall.	"Rather	neat,	isn't	it,	padre?"	queried	Harold.	"By	the way,	you've	got	to	dub	up	a	picture.	Everyone	in	the	mess	gives	one.	There's	a blank	space	over	there	that'll	do	nicely	for	a	Kirschner,	if	you're	sport	enough	for that,	Jenko'll	show	you	where	to	get	a	topper.	What's	yours,	old	son?"

"Same	as	usual,	skipper,"	said	Jenks,	throwing	himself	into	a	chair.

Harold	walked	across	to	a	little	shuttered	window	and	tapped.	A	man's	face appeared	in	the	opening,	"Four	whiskies,	Hunter—that's	all	right,	padre?"

"Yes,"	said	Peter,	and	walked	to	the	fire,	while	the	talk	became	general.

"First	time	over?"	queried	Mackay.

"Well,	how's	town?"	asked	Harold.	"Good	shows	on?	I	ought	to	be	due	next month,	but	I	think	I'll!	wait	a	bit.	Want	to	get	over	in	the	spring	and	see	a	bit	of the	country	too.	What	do	they	think	of	the	war	over	there,	Jenko?"

"It's	going	to	be	over	by	summer.	There's	a	big	push	coming	off	this	spring,	and Fritz	can't	stand	much	more.	He's	starving,	and	has	no	reserves	worth	talking	of.

The	East	does	not	matter,	though	the	doings	at	Salonika	have	depressed	them	no end.	This	show's	going	to	be	won	on	the	West,	and	that	quickly.	Got	it,	old bean?"

"Good	old	Blighty!"	ejaculated	Harold.	"But	they	don't	really	believe	all	that,	do they,	padre?"

"They	do,"	said	Peter.	"And,	to	tell	you	the	truth,	I	wondered	if	I'd	be	over	in time	myself.	Surely	the	Yanks	must	come	in	and	make	a	difference."

"This	time	next	year,	perhaps,	though	I	doubt	it.	What	do	you	think, Scottie?"

"Oh,	ask	another!	I'm	sick	of	it.	Say,	skipper,	what	about	that	run	out	into	the forest	you	talked	of?"

"Good	enough.	Would	you	care	to	go,	padre?	There's	a	wood-cuttin'	crowd	out there,	and	I	want	to	see	'em	about	firewood.	There's	a	car	possible	to-day,	and	we could	all	pack	in."

"Count	me	out,"	said	Jenks.	"I'll	have	to	toddle	over	and	report.	Sorry,	all	the same."

"I'd	love	it,"	said	Peter.	"Besides,	the	A.C.G.	said	I	was	to	look	up	those	people."

"Oh,	well	done.	It	isn't	a	joy-ride	at	all,	then.	Have	another,	padre,	and	let's	get off.	No?	Well,	I	will.	How's	yours,	Scottie?"

Ten	minutes	later	the	three	of	them	got	into	a	big	car	and	glided	smoothly	off, first	along	the	river,	and	then	up	a	steep	road	into	the	forest.	Peter,	fresh	from London,	lay	back	and	enjoyed	it	immensely.	He	had	no	idea	Normandy	boasted such	woods,	and	the	world	looked	very	good	to	him.	It	was	all	about	as	different from	what	he	had	imagined	as	it	could	possibly	have	been.	He	just	set	himself	to appreciate	it.

The	forest	was	largely	fir	and	pine,	and	the	sunlight	glanced	down	the	straight trunks	and	patterned	on	the	carpet	beneath.	Hollies	gleamed	green	against	the brown	background,	and	in	an	open	space	of	bare	beech	trees	the	littered	ground was	already	pricked	with	the	new	green	of	the	wild	hyacinth.	Now	and	again	the rounded	hills	gave	glimpses	of	the	far	Normandy	plain	across	the	serpentine

river,	then	would	as	suddenly	close	in	on	them	again	until	the	car	seemed	to	dart between	the	advancing	battalions	of	the	forest	as	though	to	escape	capture.	At length,	in	one	such	place,	they	leaped	forward	up	a	short	rise,	then	rushed	swiftly downhill,	swung	round	a	corner,	and	came	out	on	what	had	become	all	but	a	bare tableland,	set	high	so	that	one	could	see	distant	valleys—Boscherville,	Duclair—

and	yet	bare,	for	the	timber	had	been	all	but	entirely	cut	down.

Five	hundred	yards	along	this	road	brought	them	to	a	small	encampment.	There were	some	lines	of	Nysson	huts,	a	canteen	with	an	inverted	triangle	for	sign, some	tents,	great	stacks	of	timber	and	of	smaller	wood,	a	few	lorries	drawn	up and	silent,	and,	beyond,	two	or	three	buildings	of	wood	set	down	by	themselves, with	a	garden	in	front,	and	a	notice	"Officers'	Quarters."	Here,	then,	Captain Harold	stopped	the	car,	and	they	got	out.	There	were	some	jovial	introductions, and	presently	the	whole	party	set	off	across	the	cleared	space	to	where,	in	the distance,	one	could	see	the	edge	of	the	forest.

Peter	did	not	want	to	talk,	and	dropped	a	little	behind.	Harold	and	the	O.C.	of	the forestry	were	on	in	front,	and	Mackay,	with	a	junior	local	officer,	were skirmishing	about	on	the	right,	taking	pot-shots	with	small	chunks	of	wood	at	the stumps	of	trees	and	behaving	rather	like	two	school-boys.

The	air	was	all	heavy	with	resinous	scent,	and	the	carpet	beneath	soft	with	moss and	leaves	and	fragrant	slips	of	pine.	Here	and	there,	on	a	definite	plan,	a	small tree	had	been	spared,	and	when	he	joined	the	men	ahead,	Peter	learned	how careful	were	the	French	in	all	this	apparently	wholesale	felling.	In	the	forest,	as they	saw	as	they	reached	it,	the	lines	were	numbered	and	lettered	and	in	some distant	office	every	woodland	group	was	known	with	its	place	and	age.	There	are few	foresters	like	the	French,	and	it	was	cheering	to	think	that	this	great	levelling would,	in	a	score	of	years,	do	more	good	than	harm.

Slowly	biting	into	the	untouched	regiments	of	trees	were	the	men,	helped	in	their work	by	a	small	power	engine.	The	great	trunks	were	lopped	and	roughly squared	here,	and	then	dragged	by	motor	traction	to	a	slide,	which	they	now went	to	view.	It	was	a	fascinating	sight.	The	forest	ended	abruptly	on	a	high	hill, and	below,	at	their	feet,	wound	the	river.	Far	down,	working	on	a	wharf	that	had been	constructed	of	piles	driven	into	the	mud,	was	a	Belgian	detachment	with German	prisoners,	and	near	the	wharf	rough	sheds	housed	the	cutting	plant.

Where	they	stood	was	the	head	of	a	big	slide,	with	back-up	sides,	and	the	forest giants,	brought	to	the	top	from	the	place	where	they	were	felled,	were	levered

over,	to	swish	down	in	a	cloud	of	dust	to	the	waiting	men	beneath.

"Well,	skipper,	what	about	the	firewood?"	asked	Harold	as	they	stood	gazing.

"How	much	do	you	want?"	asked	the	O.C.	Forestry.

"Oh,	well,	what	can	you	let	me	have?	You've	got	stacks	of	odd	stuff	about; surely	you	can	spare	a	bit."

"It's	clean	agin	regulations,	but	could	you	send	for	it?"

"Rather!	There's	an	A.S.C.	camp	below	us,	and	the	men	there	promised	me	a lorry	if	I'd	share	the	spoils	with	them.	Will	that	do?"

"All	right.	When	will	you	send	up?"

"What's	to-day?	Wednesday?	How	about	Sunday?	I	could	put	some	boys	on	to load	up	who'd	like	the	jaunt.	How	would	Sunday	do?"

"Capital.	My	chaps	work	on	all	day,	of	course,	and	I	don't	want	to	give	them extra,	so	send	some	of	yours."

Peter	listened,	and	now	cut	in.

"Excuse	me,	sir,"	he	said,	"but	I	was	told	I	ought	to	try	and	get	a	service	of	some sort	out	here.	Could	I	come	out	on	the	lorry	and	hold	one?"

"Delighted,	padre,	of	course.	I'll	see	what	I	can	do	for	you.	About	eleven?

Probably	you	won't	get	many	men	as	there	are	usually	inspection	parades	and some	extra	fatigues	on	Sunday,	but	I'll	put	it	in	orders.	We	haven't	had	a	padre for	a	long	time."

"Eleven	would	suit	me,"	said	Peter,	"if	Captain	Harold	thinks	the	lorry	can	get	up here	by	that	time.	Will	it,	sir?"

"Oh,	I	should	think	so,	and,	anyway,	an	hour	or	so	won't	make	much	difference.

If	I	can,	I'll	come	with	you	myself.	But,	I	say,	we	ought	to	be	getting	back	now.

It	will	be	infernally	late	for	luncheon."

"Come	and	have	a	drink	before	you	start,	anyway,"	said	the	O.C.;	and	he	led	the

way	back	to	the	camp	and	into	an	enclosure	made	of	bushes	and	logs	in	the	rear of	the	mess,	where	rustic	seats	and	a	table	had	been	constructed	under	the	shade of	a	giant	oak.	"It's	rattling	here	in	summer,"	he	said,	"and	we	have	most	of	our meals	out	of	doors.	Sit	down,	won't	you?	Orderly!"

"By	Jove!	you	people	are	comfortable	out	here,"	said	Harold.	"Wish	I	had	a	job of	this	sort."

"Oh,	I	don't	know,	skipper;	it	would	feed	you	up	after	a	while,	I	think.	It's	bally lonely	in	the	evening,	and	we	can't	always	get	a	car	to	town.	It's	a	damned nuisance	getting	out	again,	too."	Then,	as	the	orderly	brought	glasses	and	a bottle:	"Have	a	spot.	It's	Haig	and	Haig,	Mackay,	and	the	right,	stuff."

"Jolly	good,	sir,"	said	that	worthy	critically.	"People	think	because	I	don't	talk broad	Scots	I'm	no	Highlander,	but	when	it	comes	to	the	whisky	I've	got	a Scottish	thirst.	Say	when,	sir."

Peter	had	another	because	he	was	warm	with	the	sense	of	good	comradeship,	and was	warmer	still	when	he	climbed	into	the	car	ten	minutes	later.	Life	seemed	so simple	and	easy;	and	he	was	struck	with	the	cheeriness	of	his	new	friends,	and the	ready	welcome	to	himself	and	his	duty.	He	waved	to	the	O.C.	"See	you Sunday,	sir,"	he	called,	out,	"'bout	eleven.	You	won't	forget	to	put	it	in	orders, will	you?	Cheerio."

"Let's	go	round	by	the	lower	road,	skipper,"	said	Mackay.	"We	can	look	in	at	that toppin'	little	pub—what's	its	name,	Croix	something?—and	besides,	the	surface is	capital	down	there."

"And	see	Marie,	eh?	But	don't	forget	you've	got	a	padre	aboard."

"Oh,	he's	all	right,	and	if	he's	going	to	be	out	here,	it's	time	he	knew Marie."

Graham	laughed.	"Carry	on,"	he	said.	"It's	all	one	to	me	where	we	go,	skipper."

He	lay	back	more	comfortably	than	ever,	and	the	big	car	leaped	forward	through the	forest,	ever	descending	towards	the	river	level.	Soon	the	trees	thinned,	and they	were	skirting	ploughed	fields.	Presently	they	ran	through	a	little	village, where	a	German	prisoner	straightened	himself	from	his	work	in	a	garden	and saluted.	Then	through	a	wood	which	suddenly	gave	a	vista	of	an	avenue	to	a

stately	house,	turreted	in	the	French	style,	a	quarter	of	a	mile	away;	then	over	a little	stream;	then	round	a	couple	of	corners,	past	a	dreamy	old	church,	and	a long	immemorial	wall,	and	so	out	into	the	straight	road	along	the	river.	The	sun gleamed	on	the	water,	and	there	were	ships	in	view,	a	British	and	a	couple	of Norwegian	tramps,	ploughing	slowly	down	to	the	sea.	On	the	far	bank	the	level of	the	land	was	low,	but	on	this	side	only	some	narrow	apple-orchards	and	here and	there	lush	water-meadows	separated	them	from	the	hills.

The	Croix	de	Guerre	stood	back	from	the	road	in	a	long	garden	just	where	a forest	bridle-path	wound	down	through	a	tiny	village	to	the	main	road.	Their chauffeur	backed	the	car	all	but	out	of	sight	into	this	path	after	they	climbed	out, and	the	three	of	them	made	for	a	sidedoor	in	a	high	wall.	Harold	opened	it	and walked	in.	The	pretty	trim	little	garden	had	a	few	flowers	in	bloom,	so	sheltered was	it,	and	Mackay	picked	a	red	rosebud	as	they	walked	up	the	path.

Harold	led	the	way	without	ceremony	into	a	parlour	that	opened	off	a	verandah, and,	finding	it	empty,	opened	a	door	beyond.	"Marie!	Marie!"	he	called.

"Ah,	Monsieur	le	Capitaine,	I	come,"	came	a	girl's	voice,	and	Marie	entered.

Peter	noticed	how	rapidly	she	took	them	all	in,	and	how	cold	were	the	eyes	that nevertheless	sparkled	and	greeted	Harold	and	Mackay	with	seeming	gaiety.	She was	short	and	dark	and	not	particularly	good-looking,	but	she	had	all	the	vivacity and	charm	of	the	French.

"Oh,	monsieur,	where	have	you	been	for	so	long?	I	thought	you	had	forgotten	La Croix	de	Guerre	altogether.	It's	the	two	weeks—no, three—since	you	come	here.

The	gentlemen	will	have	déjeuner?	And	perhaps	a	little	aperitif	before?"

"Bon	jour,	Marie,"	began	the	Captain	in	clumsy	French,	and	then	abandoned	the attempt.	"I	could	not	come,	Marie,	you	know.	C'est	la	guerre.	Much	work	each day."

"Ah,	non,	monsieur	cannot	cheat	me.	He	had	found	another	cafe	and	another girl….	Non,	non,	monsieur,	it	is	not	correct;"	and	the	girl	drew	herself	up	with	a curiously	changed	air	as	Harold	clumsily	reached	out	towards	her,	protesting.

"And	you	have	a	curé	here—how	do	you	say,	a	chapelain?"	and	Marie	beamed on	Peter.

The	two	officers	looked	at	him	and	laughed.	"What	can	I	bring	you, Monsieur	le	Capitaine	le	Curé?"	demanded	the	girl.	"Vermuth?	Cognac?"

Mackay	slipped	from	the	edge	of	the	table	on	which	he	had	been	sitting	and advanced	towards	her,	speaking	fluent	French,	with	a	curious	suggestion	of	a Scotch	accent	that	never	appeared	in	his	English.	Peter	watched	with	a	smile	on his	face	and	a	curious	medley	of	feelings,	while	the	Lieutenant	explained,	that they	could	not	stop	to	lunch,	that	they	would	take	three	mixed	vermuth,	and	that he	would	come	and	help	her	get	them.	They	went	out	together,	Marie	protesting, and	Harold,	lighting	a	cigarette	and	offering	one	to	Peter,	said	with	a	laugh:

"He's	the	boy,	is	Mackay.	Wish	I	could	sling	the	lingo	like	him.	It's	a	great country,	padre."

In	a	minute	or	two	the	pair	of	them	came	back,	Marie	was	wearing	the	rose	at	the point	of	the	little	 décolleté	of	her	black	dress,	and	was	all	over	smiles.	She carried	a	tray	with	glasses	and	a	bottle.	Mackay	carried	the	other.	With	a	great show,	he	helped	her	pour	out,	and	chatted	away	in	French	while	they	drank.

Harold	and	Peter	talked	together,	but	the	latter	caught	scraps	of	the	others'

conversation.	Mackay	wanted	to	know,	apparently,	when	she	would	be	next	in town,	and	was	urging	a	date	on	her.	Peter	caught	"Rue	Jeanne	d'Arc,"	but	little more,	and	Harold	was	insistent	on	a	move	in	a	few	minutes.	They	skirmished	at the	door	saying	"Good-bye,"	but	it	was	with	an	increased	feeling	of	the	warmth and	jollity	of	his	new	life	that	Peter	once	more	boarded	the	car.	This	time Mackay	got	in	front	and	Harold	joined	Graham	behind.	As	they	sped	off,	Peter said:

"By	Jove,	skipper,	you	do	have	a	good	time	out	here!"

Harold	flicked	off	the	ash	of	his	cigarette.	"So,	so,	padre,"	he	said.	"But	the devil's	loose.	It's	all	so	easy;	I've	never	met	a	girl	yet	who	was	not	out	for	a spree.	Of	course,	we	don't	see	anything	of	the	real	French	ladies,	though,	and	this isn't	the	line.	By	God!	when	I	think	of	the	boys	up	there,	I	feel	a	beast sometimes.	But	I	can't	help	it;	they	won't	pass	me	to	go	up,	and	it's	no	use growling	down	here	because	of	it."

"I	suppose	not,"	said	Peter,	and	leaned	back	reflecting	for	the	rest	of	the	way.	He felt	as	if	he	had	known	these	men	all	his	days,	and	as	if	his	London	life	had	been lived	on	another	planet.

After	lunch	he	was	given	a	cubicle,	and	spent	an	hour	or	two	getting	unpacked.

That	done,	just	as	he	was	about	to	sit	down	to	a	letter,	there	came	a	knock	at	the

door,	and	Mackay	looked	in.

"You	there,	padre?"	he	asked.	"There's	a	lorry	going	up	to	town	that	has	just brought	a	batch	of	men	in:	would	you	care	to	come?	I've	got	to	do	some shopping,	and	we	could	dine	at	the	club	and	come	back	afterwards."

Peter	jumped	up.	"Topping,"	he	said.	"I	want	to	get	one	or	two	things,	and	I'd love	it."

"Come	on,	then,"	said	the	other.	"I'll	meet	you	at	the	gate	in	five	minutes."

Peter	got	on	his	Sam	Browne	and	went	out,	and	after	a	bit	Mackay	joined	him.

They	jolted	up	to	town,	and	went	first	to	the	Officers'	Store	at	the	E.F.C.	Mackay bought	some	cigarettes,	and	Peter	some	flannel	collars	and	a	tie.	Together	the pair	of	them	strolled	round	town,	and	put	their	heads	in	at	the	cathedral	at	Peter's request.	He	had	a	vision	of	old	grey	stone	and	coloured	glass	and	wide	soaring spaces,	but	his	impatient	companion	hauled	him	out.	"Of	course,	you'll	want	to see	round,	padre,"	he	said,	"but	you	can	do	it	some	other	time	and	with somebody	else.	I've	seen	it	once,	and	that's	enough	for	me.	Let's	get	on	to	the club	and	book	a	table;	there's	usually	a	fearful	crowd."

Peter	was	immensely	impressed	with	the	crowd	of	men,	the	easy	greetings	of acquaintances,	and	the	way	in	which	one	was	ignored	by	the	rest.	He	was introduced	to	several	people,	who	were	all	very	cheerful,	and	in	the	long	dining-room	they	eventually	sat	down	to	table	with	two	more	officers	whom	the Scotsman	knew.	Peter	was	rather	taken	with	a	tall	man,	slightly	bald,	of	the	rank of	Captain,	who	was	attached	to	a	Labour	Corps.	He	had	travelled	a	great	deal, and	been	badly	knocked	about	in	Gallipoli.	In	a	way,	he	was	more	serious	than the	rest,	and	he	told	Peter	a	good	deal	about	the	sights	of	the	town—the	old houses	and	churches,	and	where	was	the	best	glass,	and	so	on.	Mackay	and	the fourth	made	merry,	and	Mackay,	who	called	the	W.A.A.C.	waitress	by	her Christian	name,	was	plainly	getting	over-excited.	Peter's	friend	was	obviously	a little	scornful.	"You'll	meet	a	lot	of	fools	here,	padre,"	he	said,	"old	and	young.

The	other	day	I	was	having	tea	here	when	two	old	buffers	came	in—dug-outs, shoved	into	some	job	or	another—and	they	sat	down	at	the	table	next	mine.	I couldn't	help	hearing	what	they	said.	The	older	and	fatter,	a	Colonel,	looked	out of	window,	and	remarked	ponderously:

"'By	the	way,	wasn't	Joan	of	Arc	born	about	here?'

"'No,'	said	the	second;	'down	in	Alsace-Lorraine,	I	believe.	She	was	burnt	here, and	they	threw	her	ashes	into	the	Grand	Pont.'"

Peter	laughed	silently,	and	the	other	smiled	at	him.	"Fact,"	he	said.	"That's	one type	of	ass,	and	the	second	is	(dropping	his	voice)	your	friend	here	and	his	like, if	you	don't	mind	my	saying	so.	Look	at	him	with	that	girl	now.	Somebody'll spot	it,	and	they'll	keep	an	eye	on	him.	Next	time	he	meets	her	on	the	sly	he'll	be caught	out,	and	be	up	for	it.	Damned	silly	fool,	I	think!	The	bally	girl's	only	a waitress	from	Lyons."

Peter	glanced	at	Mackay.	He	was	leaning	back	holding	the	menu,	which	she, with	covert	glances	at	the	cashier's	desk,	was	trying	to	take	away	from	him.

"Isobel,"	he	said,	"I	say,	come	here—no,	I	really	want	to	see	it—tell	me,	when do	you	get	out	next?"

"We	don't	get	no	leave	worth	talking	of,	you	know,"	she	said.	"Besides,	you	don't mean	it.	You	can't	talk	to	me	outside.	Oh,	shut	up!	I	must	go.	They'll	see	us,"	and she	darted	away.

"Damned	pretty	girl,	eh?"	said	Mackay	contentedly.	"Don't	mind	me,	padre.

It's	only	a	bit	of	a	joke.	Come	on,	let's	clear	out."

The	four	went	down	the	stairs	together	and	stood	in	a	little	group	at	the	entrance-door.	"Where	you	for	now,	Mac?"	asked	the	second	officer,	a	subaltern	of	the West	Hampshires.

"Don't	know,	old	sport.	I'm	with	the	padre.	What	you	for,	padre?"

"I	should	think	we	had	better	be	getting	back,"	said	Peter,	glancing	at	the	watch on	his	wrist.	"We've	a	long	way	to	go."

"Oh,	hang	it	all,	not	yet!	It's	a	topping	evenin'.	Let's	stroll	up	the	street."

Peter	glanced	at	the	Labour	Corps	Captain,	who	nodded,	and	they	two	turned	off together.	"There's	not	much	to	do,"	he	said.	"One	gets	sick	of	cinemas,	and	the music-hall	is	worse,	except	when	one	is	really	warmed	up	for	a	razzle-dazzle.	I don't	wonder	these	chaps	go	after	wine	and	women	more	than	they	ought.	After all,	most	of	them	are	just	loose	from	home.	You	must	make	allowances,	padre.

It's	human	nature,	you	know."

Peter	nodded	abstractedly.	It	was	the	second	time	he	had	heard	that.

"It's	all	so	jolly	different	from	what	I	expected,"	he	said	meditatively.

"I	know,"	said	the	other.	"Not	much	danger	or	poverty	or	suffering	here, seemingly.	But	you	never	can	tell.	Look	at	those	girls:	I	bet	you	would	probably sum	them	up	altogether	wrongly	if	you	tried."

Peter	glanced	at	a	couple	of	French	women	who	were	passing.	The	pair	were looking	at	them,	and	in	the	light	of	a	brilliantly	lit	cinema	they	showed	up clearly.	The	paint	was	laid	on	shamelessly;	their	costumes,	made	in	one	piece, were	edged	with	fur	and	very	gay.	Each	carried	a	handbag	and	one	a	tasselled stick.	"Good-night,	chérie,"	said	one,	as	they	passed.

Peter	gave	a	little	shudder.	"How	ghastly!"	he	said.	"How	can	anyone	speak	to them?	Are	there	many	like	that	about?"	He	glanced	back	again:	"Why,	good heavens,"	he	cried,	"one's	Marie!"

"Hullo,	padre,"	said	his	friend,	the	ghost	of	a	smile	beginning	about	his	lips.

"Where	have	you	been?	Marie!	By	Jove!	I	shall	have	to	report	you	to	the A.C.G."

Peter	blushed	furiously.	"It	was	at	an	inn,"	he	said,	"this	morning,	as	we	were coming	back	from	the	forest.	But	she	seemed	so	much	better	then,	Mackay	knew her;	why,	I	heard	him	say…."

He	glanced	back	at	the	sudden	recollection.	The	two	girls	were	speaking	to	the two	others,	twenty	paces	or	so	behind.	"Oh,"	he	exclaimed,	"look	here!…"

The	tall	Labour	man	slipped	his	arm	in	his	and	interrupted.	"Come	on,	padre,"	he said;	"you	can't	do	anything.	Mackay's	had	a	bit	too	much	as	it	is,	and	the	other chap	is	looking	for	a	night	out.	We'll	stroll	past	the	cathedral,	and	I'll	see	you	a bit	of	the	way	home."

"But	how	damnable,	how	beastly!"	exclaimed	Peter.	"It	makes	one	sick!…"	He broke	off,	and	the	two	walked	on	in	silence.

"Is	there	much	of	that?"	Peter	demanded	suddenly.

The	other	glanced	at	him.	"You'll	find	out	without	my	telling	you,"	he	said;	"but don't	be	too	vehement	till	you've	got	your	eyes	open.	There	are	worse	things."

"There	can't	be,"	broke	in	Peter.	"Women	like	that,	and	men	who	will	go	with them,	aren't	fit	to	be	called	men	and	women.	There's	no	excuse.	It's	bestial,	that's what	it	is."

"You	wouldn't	speak	to	one?"	queried	the	other.

"Good	heavens,	no!	Do	you	forget	what	I	am?"

"No,	I	don't,	padre,	but	look	here,	I'm	not	a	Christian,	and	I	take	a	common-sense view	of	these	things,	but	I'm	bound	to	say	I	think	you're	on	the	wrong	tack,	too.

Didn't	Christ	have	compassion	on	people	like	that?	Didn't	He	eat	and	drink	with publicans	and	sinners?"

"Yes,	to	convert	them.	You	can't	name	the	two	things	in	the	same	breath.	He	had compassion	on	the	multitude	of	hungry	women	and	children	and	misguided	men, but	He	hated	sin.	You	can't	deny	that."	Peter	recalled	his	sermon;	he	was	rather indignant,	unreasonably,	that	the	suggestion	should	have	been	made.

"So?"	said	the	other	laconically.	"Well,	you	know	more	about	it	than I	do,	I	suppose.	Come	on;	we	go	down	here."

They	parted	at	the	corner	by	the	river	again,	and	Peter	set	out	for	his	long	walk home	alone.	It	was	a	lovely	evening	of	stars,	cool,	but	not	too	cold,	and	at	first the	streets	were	full	of	people.	He	kept	to	the	curb	or	walked	in	the	road	till	he was	out	of	the	town,	taking	salutes	automatically,	his	thoughts	far	away.	The little	 cafés	debits	were	crowded,	largely	by	Tommies.	He	was	not	accosted	again, for	he	walked	fast,	but	he	saw	enough	as	he	went.

More	than	an	hour	later	he	swung	into	camp,	and	went	to	his	room,	lit	a	candle, and	shut	the	door.	Tunic	off,	he	sat	on	the	edge	of	the	camp-bed	and	stared	at	the light.	He	seemed	to	have	lived	a	year	in	a	day,	and	he	felt	unclean.	He	thought	of Hilda,	and	then	actually	smiled,	for	Hilda	and	this	life	seemed	so	incredibly	far apart.	He	could	not	conceive	of	her	even	knowing	of	its	existence.	Yet,	he supposed,	she	knew,	as	he	had	done,	that	such	things	were.	He	had	even preached	about	them….	It	suddenly	struck	him	that	he	had	talked	rot	in	the pulpit,	talked	of	things	of	which	he	knew	nothing.	Yet,	of	course,	his	attitude	had been	right.

He	wondered	if	he	should	speak	to	Mackay,	and,	so	wondering,	fell	forward	on his	knees.





CHAPTER	IV

Hilda's	religion	was,	like	the	religion	of	a	great	many	Englishwomen	of	her class,	of	a	very	curious	sort.	She	never,	of	course,	analysed	it	herself,	and conceivably	she	would	object	very	strongly	to	the	description	set	down	here,	but in	practical	fact	there	is	no	doubt	about	the	analysis.	To	begin	with,	this conventional	and	charming	young	lady	of	Park	Lane	had	in	common	with Napoleon	Bonaparte	that	Christianity	meant	more	to	them	both	as	the	secret	of social	order	than	as	the	mystery	of	the	Incarnation.	Hilda	was	convinced	that	a decent	and	orderly	life	rested	on	certain	agreements	and	conclusions	in	respect	to marriage	and	class	and	conduct,	and	that	these	agreements	and	conclusions	were admirably	stated	in	the	Book	of	Common	Prayer,	and	most	ably	and	decorously advocated	from	the	pulpit	of	St.	John's.	She	would	have	said	that	she	believed the	agreements	and	conclusions	because	of	the	Prayer	Book,	but	in	fact	she	had primarily	given	in	her	allegiance	to	a	social	system,	and	supported	the	Prayer Book	because	of	its	support	of	that.	Once	a	month	she	repeated	the	Nicene Creed,	but	only	because,	in	the	nature	of	things,	the	Nicene	Creed	was	given	her once	a	month	to	repeat,	and	she	never	really	conceived	that	people	might	worry strenuously	about	it,	any	more	than	she	did.	Being	an	intelligent	girl,	she	knew, of	course,	that	people	did,	and	occasionally	preachers	occupied	the	pulpit	of	St.

John's	who	were	apparently	quite	anxious	that	she	and	the	rest	of	the congregation	should	understand	that	it	meant	this	and	not	that,	or	that	and	not this,	according	to	the	particular	enthusiasm	of	the	clergyman	of	the	moment.

Sentence	by	sentence	she	more	or	less	understood	what	these	gentlemen	keenly urged	upon	her;	as	a	whole	she	understood	nothing.	She	was	far	too	much	the child	of	her	environment	and	age	not	to	perceive	that	Mr.	Lloyd	George's experiments	in	class	legislation	were	vastly	more	important.

Peter,	therefore,	had	always	been	a	bit	of	an	enigma	to	her.	As	a	rule	he	fitted	in with	the	scheme	of	things	perfectly	well,	for	he	was	a	gentleman,	he	liked	nice things,	and	he	was	splendidly	keen	on	charity	organisation	and	the	reform	of

abuses	on	right	lines.	But	now	and	again	he	said	and	did	things	which	perturbed her.	It	was	as	if	she	had	gradually	become	complete	mistress	of	a	house,	and	then had	suddenly	discovered	a	new	room	into	which	she	peeped	for	a	minute	before it	was	lost	to	her	again	and	the	door	shut.	It	was	no	Bluebeard's	chamber	into which	she	looked;	it	was	much	more	that	she	had	a	suspicion	that	the	room contained	a	live	mistress	who	might	come	out	one	day	and	dispute	her	own	title.

She	could	tell	how	Peter	would	act	nine	times	out	of	ten;	she	knew	by	instinct,	a great	deal	better	than	he	did,	the	conceptions	that	ruled	his	life;	but	now	and again	he	would	hesitate	perplexedly	as	if	at	the	thought	of	something	that	she	did not	understand,	or	act	suddenly	in	response	to	an	overwhelming	flood	of	impulse whose	spring	was	beyond	her	control	or	even	her	surmise.	Women	mother	all their	men	because	men	are	on	the	whole	such	big	babies,	but	from	a	generation of	babies	is	born	occasionally	the	master.	Women	get	so	used	to	the	rule	that they	forget	the	exception.	When	he	comes,	then,	they	are	troubled.

But	this	was	not	all	Hilda's	religion.	For	some	mysterious	reason	this	product	of a	highly	civilised	community	had	the	elemental	in	her.	Men	and	women	both have	got	to	eliminate	all	trace	of	sex	before	they	can	altogether	escape	that.	In other	words,	because	in	her	lay	latent	the	power	of	birth,	in	which	moment	she would	be	cloistered	alone	in	a	dark	and	silent	room	with	infinity,	she	clung unreasonably	and	all	but	unconsciously	to	certain	superstitions	which	she	shared with	primitive	savages	and	fetish-worshippers.	All	of	which	seems	a	far	cry	from the	War	Intercession	Services	at	wealthy	and	fashionable	St.	John's,	but	it	was nothing	more	or	less	than	this	which	was	causing	her	to	kneel	on	a	high	hassock, elbows	comfortably	on	the	prayer-rail,	and	her	face	in	her	hands,	on	a	certain Friday	evening	in	the	week	after	Peter's	arrival	in	France,	while	the	senior	curate (after	suitable	pauses,	during	which	her	mind	was	uncontrollably	busy	with	an infinite	number	of	things,	ranging	from	the	doings	of	Peter	in	France	to	the increasing	difficulty	of	obtaining	silk	stockings),	intoned	the	excellent	stately English	of	the	Prayers	set	forth	by	Authority	in	Time	of	War.

Two	pews	ahead	of	her	knelt	Sir	Robert	Doyle,	in	uniform.	That	simple	soldier was	a	bigger	child	than	most	men,	and	was,	therefore,	still	conscious	of	a number	of	unfathomable	things	about	him,	for	the	which	Hilda,	his	godchild, adored	and	loved	him	as	a	mother	will	adore	her	child	who	sits	in	a	field	of buttercups	and	sees,	not	minted,	nor	botanical,	but	heavenly	gold.	He	was	all	the more	lovable,	because	he	conceived	that	he	was	much	bigger	and	stronger	than she,	and	perfectly	capable	of	looking	after	her.	In	that,	he	was	like	a	plucky	boy who	gets	up	from	his	buttercups	to	tell	his	mother	not	to	be	frightened	when	a

cow	comes	into	the	field.

They	went	out	together,	and	greeted	each	other	in	the	porch.

"Good-evening,	child,"	said	the	soldier,	with	a	smile.	"And	how's	Peter?"

Hilda	smiled	back,	but	after	a	rather	wintry	fashion,	which	the	man	was	quick	to note.	"I	couldn't	have	told	you	fresh	news	yesterday,"	she	said,	"but	I	had	a	letter this	morning	all	about	his	first	Sunday.	He's	at	Rouen	at	a	rest	camp	for	the present,	though	he	thinks	he's	likely	to	be	moved	almost	at	once;	and	he's	quite well."

"And	then?"	queried	the	other	affectionately.

"Oh,	he	doesn't	know	at	all,	but	he	says	he	doesn't	think	there's	any	chance	of	his getting	up	the	line.	He'll	be	sent	to	another	part	where	there	is	likely	to	be	a shortage	of	chaplains	soon."

"Well,	that's	all	right,	isn't	it?	He's	in	no	danger	at	Rouen,	at	any	rate.	If	we	go	on as	we're	going	on	now,	they	won't	even	hear	the	guns	down	there	soon.	Come, little	girl,	what's	worrying	you?	I	can	see	there's	something."

They	were	in	the	street	now,	walking	towards	the	park,	and	Hilda	did	not immediately	reply.	Then	she	said:	"What	are	you	going	to	do?	Can't	you	come	in for	a	little?	Father	and	mother	will	be	out	till	late,	and	you	can	keep	me company."

He	glanced	at	his	watch.	"I've	got	to	be	at	the	War	Office	later,"	he	said,	"but	my man	doesn't	reach	town	till	after	ten,	so	I	will.	The	club's	not	over-attractive these	days.	What	with	the	men	who	think	one	knows	everything	and	won't	tell, and	the	men	who	think	they	know	everything	and	want	to	tell,	it's	a	bit	trying."

Hilda	laughed	merrily.	"Poor	Uncle	Bob,"	she	said,	giving	him	her	childhood's name	that	had	never	been	discontinued	between	them.	"You	shall	come	home with	me,	and	sit	in	father's	chair,	and	have	a	still	decent	whisky	and	a	cigar,	and if	you're	very	good	I'll	read	you	part	of	Peter's	letter."

"What	would	Peter	say?"

"Oh,	he	wouldn't	mind	the	bits	I'll	read	to	you.	Indeed,	I	think	he'd	like	it:	he'd like	to	know	what	you	think.	You	see,	he's	awfully	depressed;	he	feels	he's	not

wanted	out	there,	and—though	I	don't	know	what	he	means—that	things, religious	things,	you	know,	aren't	real."

"Not	wanted,	eh?"	queried	the	old	soldier.	"Now,	I	wonder	why	he	resents	that.

Is	it	because	he	feels	snubbed?	I	shouldn't	be	surprised	if	he	had	a	bit	of	a swelled	head,	your	young	man,	you	know,	Hilda."

"Sir	Robert	Doyle,	if	you're	going	to	be	beastly,	you	can	go	to	your	horrid	old club,	and	I	only	hope	you'll	be	worried	to	death.	Of	course	it	isn't	that.	Besides, he	says	everyone	is	very	friendly	and	welcomes	him—only	he	feels	that	that makes	it	worse.	He	thinks	they	don't	want—well,	what	he	has	to	give,	I suppose."

"What	he	has	to	give?	But	what	in	the	world	has	he	to	give?	He	has	to	take parade	services,	and	visit	hospitals	and"	(he	was	just	going	to	say	"bury	the dead,"	but	thought	it	hardly	sounded	pleasant),	"make	himself	generally	decent and	useful,	I	suppose.	That's	what	chaplains	did	when	I	was	a	subaltern,	and jolly	decent	fellows	they	usually	were."

"Well,	I	know.	That's	what	I	should	feel,	and	that's	what	I	don't	quite	understand.

I	suppose	he	feels	he's	responsible	for	making	the	men	religious—it	reads	like that.	But	you	shall	hear	the	letter	yourself."

Doyle	digested	this	for	a	while	in	silence.	Then	he	gave	a	sort	of	snort,	which	is inimitable,	but	always	accompanied	his	outbursts	against	things	slightly	more recent	than	the	sixties.	It	had	the	effect	of	rousing	Hilda,	at	any	rate.

"Don't,	you	dear	old	thing,"	she	said,	clutching	his	arm.	"I	know	exactly	what you're	going	to	say.	Young	men	of	your	day	minded	their	business	and	did	their duty,	and	didn't	theorise	so	much.	Very	likely.	But,	you	see,	our	young	men	had the	misfortune	to	be	born	a	little	later	than	you.	And	they	can't	help	it."	She sighed	a	little.	"It	 is	trying	sometimes….	But	they're	all	right	really,	and	they'll come	back	to	things."

They	were	at	the	gate	by	now.	Sir	Robert	stood	aside	to	let	her	pass.	"I	know, dear,"	he	said,	"I'm	an	old	fogey.	Besides,	young	Graham	has	good	stuff	in	him

—I	always	said	so.	But	if	he's	on	the	tack	of	trying	to	stick	his	fingers	into people's	souls,	he's	made	a	mistake	in	going	to	France.	I	know	Tommy—or	I	did know	him.	(The	Lord	alone	knows	what's	in	the	Army	these	days.)	He	doesn't want	that	sort	of	thing.	He	swears	and	he	grouses	and	he	drinks,	but	he	respects

God	Almighty	more	than	you'd	think,	and	he	serves	his	Queen—I	mean	his King.	A	parade	service	is	a	parade,	and	it's	a	bore	at	times,	but	it's	discipline,	and it	helps	in	the	end.	Like	that	little	'do'	to-night,	it	helps.	One	comes	away	feelin'

one	can	stand	a	bit	more	for	the	sake	of	the	decent,	clean	things	of	life."

Hilda	regarded	the	fine,	straight	old	man	for	a	second	as	they	stood,	on	the	top	of the	steps.	Then	her	eyes	grew	a	little	misty.	"God	bless	you,	Uncle	Bob,"	she said.	"You	 do	understand."	And	the	two	went	in	together.

Hilda	opened	the	door	of	the	study.	"I'm	going	to	make	you	comfortable	myself,"

she	said.	She	pulled	a	big	armchair	round;	placed	a	reading-lamp	on	a	small table	and	drew	it	close;	and	she	made	the	old	soldier	sit	in	the	chair.	Then	she unlocked	a	little	cupboard,	and	got	out	a	decanter	and	siphon	and	glass,	and	a box	of	cigars.	She	placed	these	by	his	side,	and	stood	back	quizzically	a	second.

Then	she	threw	a	big	leather	cushion	at	his	feet	and	walked	to	the	switches, turning	off	the	main	light	and	leaving	only	the	shaded	radiance	of	the	reading-lamp.	She	turned	the	shade	of	it	so	that	the	light	would	fall	on	the	letter	while she	sat	on	the	cushion,	and	then	she	bent	down,	kissed	her	godfather,	and	went	to the	door.	"I	won't	be	a	moment,	Uncle	Bob,"	she	said.	"Help	yourself,	and	get comfortable."

Five	minutes	later	the	door	opened	and	she	came	in.	As	she	moved	into	the	circle of	light,	the	man	felt	an	absurd	satisfaction,	as	if	he	were	partly	responsible	for the	dignified	figure	with	its	beautifully	waved	soft,	fair	hair,	of	which	he	was	so proud.	She	smiled	on	him,	and	sat	down	at	his	feet,	leaning	back	against	his chair	and	placing	her	left	elbow	on	his	knees.	He	laid	a	caressing	hand	on	her arm,	and	then	looked	steadily	in	front	of	him	lest	he	should	see	more	than	she wished.

Hilda	rustled	the	sheets.	"The	first	is	all	about	me,"	she	explained,	"and	I'll	skip that.	Let	me	see—yes,	here	we	are.	Now	listen.	It's	rather	long,	but	you	mustn't say	anything	till	I've	finished."

"'Saturday'	(Peter's	letter	ran)	I	gave	up	to	getting	ready	for	Sunday,	though Harold'	(he's	the	O.C.	of	the	camp,	Peter	says,	a	jolly	decent	sort	of	man)	'wanted me	to	go	up	town	with	him.	I	had	had	a	talk	with	him	about	the	services,	and	had fixed	up	to	have	a	celebration	in	the	morning	in	the	Y.M.C.A.	in	camp—they have	a	quiet	room,	and	there	is	a	table	in	it	that	one	puts	against	the	wall	and uses	for	an	altar—and	an	evening	service	in	the	canteen-hall	part	of	the	place.	I

couldn't	have	a	morning	service,	as	I	was	to	go	out	to	the	forest	camp,	as	I	have told	you.'	He	said	in	his	first	letter	how	he	had	been	motored	out	to	see	a	camp	in the	forest	where	they	are	cutting	wood	for	something,	and	he	had	fixed	up	a parade,"	said	Hilda,	looking	up.	Doyle	nodded	gravely,	and	she	went	on	reading:

"'Harold	said	he'd	like	to	take	Communion,	and	that	I	could	put	up	a	notice	in	the anteroom	of	the	Officers'	Mess.

"'Well,	I	spent	the	morning	preparing	sermons.	I	thought	I'd	preach	from	"The axe	is	laid	to	the	root	of	the	tree"	in	the	forest,	and	make	a	sort	of	little	parable out	of	it	for	the	men.	I	planned	to	say	how	Christ	was	really	watching	and	testing each	one	of	us,	especially	out	here,	and	to	begin	by	talking	a	bit	about	Germany, and	how	the	axe	was	being	laid	to	that	tree	because	it	wouldn't	bear	good	fruit.	I couldn't	get	much	for	the	evening,	so	I	thought	I'd	leave	it,	and	perhaps	say	much the	same	as	the	morning,	only	differently	introduced.	I	went	and	saw	the	hut manager,	a	very	decent	fellow	who	is	a	Baptist	minister	at	home,	and	he	said he'd	like	to	come	in	the	morning.	Well,	I	didn't	know	what	to	say	to	that;	I	hated to	hurt	him,	and,	of	course,	he	has	no	Baptist	chapel	out	here;	but	I	didn't	know what	the	regulations	might	be,	and	excused	myself	on	those	grounds.

"'Then	in	the	afternoon	I	went	round	the	camp.	Oh,	Hilda,	I	was	fearfully nervous—I	don't	know	why	exactly,	but	I	was.	The	men	were	playing	"crown and	anchor,"	and	sleeping,	and	cleaning	kit	(this	is	a	rest	camp	you	know),	and	it seemed	so	cold-blooded	somehow.	I	told	them	anyone	could	come	in	the evening	if	he	wanted	to,	but	that	in	the	morning	the	service	was	for	Church	of England	communicants.	I	must	say	I	was	very	bucked	up	over	the	result.	I	had no	end	of	promises,	and	those	who	were	going	to	be	out	in	the	evening	said	so straight	out.	Quite	thirty	said	they'd	come	in	the	morning,	and	they	were	very respectful	and	decent.	Then	I	wrote	out	and	put	up	my	notices.	The	mess	ragged a	bit	about	it,	but	quite	decently	("Here's	the	padre	actually	going	to	do	a	bit	of work!"	and	the	usual	"I	shall	be	a	chaplain	in	the	next	war!");	and	I	mentioned	to one	or	two	whom	I	knew	to	be	Church	of	England	that	Captain	Harold	had	said he	would	come	to	the	early	service.	Someone	had	told	me	that	if	the	O.C.	of	a camp	comes,	the	others	often	will.	After	dinner	we	settled	down	to	bridge,	and about	ten-thirty	I	was	just	going	off	to	bed	when	Harold	came	in	with	two	or three	other	men.	Well,	I	hate	to	tell	you,	dear,	but	I	promised	I'd	write,	and, besides,	I	do	want	to	talk	to	somebody.	Anyway,	he	was	what	they	call	"merry,"

and	he	and	his	friends	were	full	of	talk	about	what	they'd	done	up	town.	I	don't know	that	it	was	anything	very	bad,	but	it	was	awful	to	me	to	think	that	this	chap was	going	to	communicate	next	day.	I	didn't	know	what	to	do,	but	I	couldn't	say

anything	then,	and	I	slipped	off	to	bed	as	soon	as	I	could.	They	made	a	huge	row in	the	anteroom	for	some	time,	but	at	last	I	got	to	sleep.

"'Next	morning	I	was	up	early,	and	got	things	fixed	up	nicely.	At	eight	o'clock one	man	came	rather	sheepishly—a	young	chap	I'd	seen	the	day	before—and	I waited	for	some	five	minutes	more.	Then	I	began.	About	the	Creed,	Harold	came in,	and	so	we	finished	the	service.	Neither	of	them	seemed	to	know	the	responses at	all,	and	I	don't	think	I	have	ever	felt	more	miserable.	However,	I	had	done	all	I could	do,	and	I	let	it	go	at	that.	I	comforted	myself	that	I	would	get	on	better	in the	forest,	where	I	thought	there	was	to	be	a	parade.

"'We	got	out	about	eleven	o'clock,	and	I	went	to	the	O.C.'s	hut.	He	was	sitting	in a	deck	chair	reading	a	novel.	He	jumped	up	when	he	saw	me,	and	was	full	of apologies.	He'd	absolutely	forgotten	I	was	coming,	and	so	no	notice	had	been given,	and,	anyway,	apparently	it	isn't	the	custom	in	these	camps	to	have	ordered parade	services.	He	sent	for	the	Sergeant-Major,	who	said	the	men	were	mostly cleaning	camp,	but	he	thought	he	could	get	some	together.	So	I	sat	and	talked	for about	twenty	minutes,	and	then	went	over.	The	canteen	had	been	opened,	and there	were	about	twenty	men	there.	They	all	looked	as	if	they	had	been	forced	in, except	one,	who	turned	out	to	be	a	Wesleyan,	and	chose	the	hymns	out	of	the Y.M.C.A.	books	in	the	place.	They	had	mission	hymns,	and	the	only	one	that went	well	was	"Throw	out	the	life-line,"	which	is	really	a	rather	ghastly	thing.

We	had	short	Matins,	and	I	preached	as	I	had	arranged.	The	men	sat	stiffly	and looked	at	me.	I	don't	know	why,	but	I	couldn't	work	up	any	enthusiasm	and	it	all seemed	futile.	Afterwards	I	tried	to	talk	to	this	Wesleyan	corporal.	He	was	great on	forming	a	choir	to	learn	hymns,	and	then	I	said	straight	out	that	I	was	new	to this	sort	of	work,	and	I	hoped	what	I	had	said	was	all	right.	He	said:	"Yes,	sir, very	nice,	I'm	sure;	but,	if	you'll	excuse	me,	what	the	men	need	is	converting."

"'Said	I:	"What	exactly	do	you	mean	by	that,	corporal?"

"'"Well,	sir,"	he	said	"they	want	to	be	led	to	put	their	trust	in	the Lord	and	get	right	with	God.	There's	many	a	rough	lad	in	this	camp,	sir.

If	you	knew	what	went	on,	you'd	see	it."

"I	said	that	I	had	told	them	God	was	watching	them,	and	that	we	had	to	ask	His daily	help	to	live	clean,	honest	lives,	and	truly	repent	of	our	sins.

"'"Yes,	you	did,	sir,"	he	said.	"That's	what	I	say,	sir,	it	was	very	nice;	only

somehow	these	chaps	have	heard	that	before.	It	don't	grip,	sir.	Now,	we	had	a preacher	in	our	chapel	once…."	And	he	went	on	to	tell	me	of	some	revival mission.

"'Well,	I	went	back	to	the	O.C.	He	wanted	me	to	have	a	drink,	and	I	did,	for,	to tell	you	the	truth,	I	felt	like	it.	Then	I	got	back	to	camp.

"'In	the	afternoon	I	went	round	the	lines	again.	Hilda,	I	 wish	I	could	tell	you what	I	felt.	Everyone	was	decent	enough,	but	the	men	would	get	up	and	salute	as I	came	up,	and	by	the	very	sound	of	their	voices	you	could	tell	how	their	talk changed	as	soon	as	they	saw	me.	Mind	you,	they	were	much	more	friendly	than men	at	home,	but	I	felt	all	the	time	out	of	touch.	They	didn't	want	me,	and somehow	Christ	and	the	Gospel	seemed	a	long	way	off.	However,	we	had	the evening	service.	The	hut	was	fairly	full,	which	pleased	me,	and	I	preached	a much	more	"Gospel"	address	than	in	the	morning.	Some	officers	came,	and	then afterwards	two	or	three	of	us	went	out	for	a	stroll	and	a	talk.

"'Among	these	officers	was	a	tall	chap	I	had	met	at	the	club,	named	Langton.	He had	come	down	to	see	somebody	in	our	mess,	and	had	come	on	to	service.	He	is an	extraordinarily	nice	person,	different	from	most,	a	man	who	thinks	a	lot	and controls	himself.	He	did	most	of	the	talking,	and	began	as	we	strolled	up	the	hill.

"'"Padre,"	he	said,	"how	 does	Christ	save	us?"

"'I	said	He	had	died	to	obtain	our	forgiveness	from	God,	and	that,	if	we	trusted	in Him,	He	would	forgive	and	help	us	to	live	nobler	and	manlier	lives.	(Of	course,	I said	much	more,	but	I	see	plainly	that	that	is	what	it	all	comes	to.)

"'When	I	had	done,	he	walked	on	for	a	bit	in	silence,	and	then	he	said,

"Do	you	think	the	men	understand	that?"

"'I	said	I	thought	and	hoped	they	might.	It	was	simple	enough.

"'"Well,"	he	said,	"it's	hopeless	jargon	to	me.	If	I	try	to	analyse	it, I	am	knocked	out	right	and	left	by	countless	questions;	but	leave	that.

It	is	when	I	try	to	take	you	practically	at	your	word	that	I	find	you	are mumbling	a	fetish.	Forgive	me,	but	it	is	so."

"'I	was	a	little	annoyed	and	very	troubled.	"Do	explain,"	I	said.

"'"All	right,	only	you	mustn't	mind	if	I	hurt	you,"	he	said.	"Take	 Trust	in	Christ

—well,	that	either	means	that	a	man	gets	intoxicated	by	an	idea	which	does control	his	life,	just	as	it	would	if	he	were	intoxicated	by	the	idea	 Trust	in Buddha,	or	else	it	comes	to	nothing.	I	can't	really	trust	in	a	dead	man,	or	a	man on	the	right	hand	of	the	throne	of	God.	What	Tommy	wants	is	a	pal	to	lean	on	in the	canteen	and	the	street.	He	wants	somebody	more	real	and	more	lovable	and more	desirable	than	the	girl	who	tempts	him	into	sin.	And	he	can't	be	found.	Was he	in	your	service	to-night?	Can	he	be	emotionally	conjured	up	by	'Yield	not	to temptation'	or	'Dare	to	be	a	Daniel'?	Be	honest,	padre—the	thing	is	a	spectre	of the	imagination."

"'I	was	absolutely	silent.	He	went	on:

"'"You	make	much	talk	of	sin	and	forgiveness.	Well,	Tommy	doesn't	understand what	you	mean	by	sin.	He	is	confused	to	bits	about	it;	but	the	main	thing	that stands	out	is	that	a	man	may	break	all	the	Ten	Commandments	theologically	and yet	be	a	rattling	good	pal,	as	brave	as	a	lion,	as	merry	as	a	cricket,	and	the	life and	soul	and	 Christ	of	a	platoon.	That's	the	fact,	and	it	is	the	one	thing	that matters.	But	there	is	another	thing:	if	a	man	sins,	how	is	he	to	get	forgiveness?

What	sort	of	a	God	is	it	Who	will	wipe	the	whole	blessed	thing	out	because	in	a moment	of	enthusiasm	the	sinner	says	he	is	sorry?	If	that's	all	sin	is,	it	isn't	worth worrying	about,	and	if	that	is	all	God	is,	He's	not	got	the	makings	of	a	decent O.C."

"'"Good	for	you,	skipper,"	said	the	other	man.

"'Langton	rounded	on	him.	"It	isn't	good	for	me	or	for	anyone,"	he	said.	"And	I'll tell	you	what,	my	boy:	all	that	I've	said	doesn't	justify	a	man	making	a	beast	of himself,	which	is	what	the	majority	of	us	do.	I	can	see	that	a	man	may	very wisely	get	drunk	at	times,	but	he's	a	——	fool	to	get	himself	sodden	with	drink."

(And	he	went	on	to	more,	Hilda,	that	I	can't	write	to	you.)

"'Well,	I	don't	know	what	I	said.	I	went	back	utterly	miserable.	Oh,	Hilda,	I	think I	never	ought	to	have	come	out	here.	Langton's	right	in	a	way.	We	clergy	have said	the	same	thing	so	often	that	we	forget	how	it	strikes	a	practical	common-sense	man.	But	there	must	be	an	answer	somewhere,	if	I	only	knew	it.	Meantime I'm	like	a	doctor	among	the	dying	who	cannot	diagnose	the	disease.	I'm	like	a salesman	with	a	shop	full	of	goods	that	nobody	wants	because	they	don't	fulfil the	advertisement.	And	I	never	felt	more	utterly	alone	in	my	life.

"'These	men	talk	a	different	language	from	mine;	they	belong	to	another	world.

They	are	such	jolly	good	fellows	that	they	are	prepared	to	accept	me	as	a comrade	without	question,	but	as	for	my	message,	I	might	as	well	be	trying	to cure	smallpox	by	mouthing	sonorous	Virgil—only	it	is	worse	than	that,	for	they no	longer	even	believe	that	the	diagnosis	is	what	I	say.	And	what	gets	over	me	is that	they	are,	on	the	whole,	decent	chaps.	There's	Harold—he's	probably immoral	and	he	certainly	drinks	too	much,	but	he's	as	unselfish	as	possible,	and	I feel	in	my	bones	he'd	do	anything	to	help	a	friend.

"'Of	course,	I	hate	their	vices.	The	sights	in	the	streets	make	me	feel	positively sick.	I	wouldn't	touch	what	they	touch	with	a	stick.	When	I	think	of	you,	so honest	and	upright	and	clean….'	Oh,	but	I	needn't	read	that,	Uncle	Bob."	She turned	over	a	page	or	so.	"I	think	that's	all.	No,	just	this:

"'I've	been	made	mess	secretary,	and	I	serve	out	coffee	in	the	canteen	for	a couple	of	hours	every	other	day.	That's	about	all	there	is	to	do.	I	wish	to	Heaven I	had	an	ordinary	commission!"

The	girl's	voice	ceased	with	a	suspicious	suddenness,	and	the	man's	hand tightened	on	her	arm.	For	a	minute	they	remained	so,	and	then,	impulsively	and unrestrained,	she	half-turned	and	sobbed	out	against	his	knees:

"Oh,	Uncle	Bob,	I'm	so	unhappy!	I	feel	so	sorry	for	him.	And—and—the	worst is,	I	don't	really	understand….	I	don't	see	what	worries	him.	Our	religion	is	good enough,	I'm	sure.	Oh,	I	 hate	those	beasts	of	men	out	there!	Peter's	too	good	for them.	I	wish	he'd	never	gone.	I	feel	as	if	he'd	never	come	back!"

"There,	there,	my	dear,"	said	the	old	soldier,	uncomfortably.	"Don't	take	on	so.

He'll	find	his	feet,	you	know.	It's	not	so	bad	as	that.	You	can	trust	him,	can't you?"

She	nodded	vigorously.	"But	what	do	 you	think	of	it	all?"	she	demanded.

Sir	Robert	Doyle	cleared	his	throat.	"Well,"	he	began,	but	stopped.	To	him	it	was an	extraordinarily	hard	thing	to	speak	of	religion,	partly	because	he	cherished	so whole-heartedly	what	he	had	got,	and	partly	because	he	had	never	formulated	it, probably	for	that	very	reason.	Sir	Robert	could	hardly	have	told	his	Maker	what he	believed	about	Him.	When	he	said	the	Creed	he	always	said	it	with	lowered voice	and	bowed	head,	as	one	who	considered	very	deeply	of	the	matter,	but	in fact	he	practically	never	considered	at	all….

"Well,"	he	began	again,	"you	see,	dear,	it's	a	strange	time	out	there,	and	it	is	a damned	unpleasant	age,	if	you'll	excuse	me.	People	can't	take	anything	these days	without	asking	an	infernal	number	of	questions.	Some	blessed	Socialist'll begin	to	ask	why	a	man	should	love	his	mother	next,	and,	not	getting	a	scientific answer,	argue	that	one	shouldn't.	As	for	the	men,	they're	all	right,	or	they	used	to be.	'Love	the	Brotherhood.	Fear	God.	Honour	the	King'—that's	about	enough	for you	and	me,	I	take	it,	and	Graham'll	find	it's	enough	for	him.	And	he'll	play	the game,	and	decent	men	will	like	him	and	get—er—helped,	my	dear.	That's	all there	is	to	it.	But	it's	a	pity,"	added	the	old	Victorian	Regular,	"that	these	blessed labour	corps,	and	rest	camps,	and	all	the	rest	of	it,	don't	have	parade	services.

The	boy's	bound	to	miss	that.	I'm	hanged	if	I	don't	speak	about	it!…	And	that reminds	me….	Good	Lord,	it's	ten	o'clock!	I	must	go."

He	started	up,	Hilda	rose,	smiling	a	little.

"That's	better,"	said	the	old	fellow;	"must	be	a	man,	what?	It's	all	a	bit	of	the	war, you	know."

"Oh,	Uncle	Bob,	you	 are	a	dear.	You	do	cheer	one	up,	somehow.	I	wish	men were	more	like	you."

"No,	you	don't,	my	dear,	don't	you	think	it.	I'm	a	back	number,	and	you	know	it, as	well	as	any."

"You're	not,	Uncle	Bob.	I	won't	have	you	say	it.	Give	me	a	kiss	and	say	you	don't mean	it."

"Well,	well,	Hilda,	there	is	life	in	the	old	dog	yet,	and	I	must	be	off	and	show	it.

No,	I	won't	have	another,	not	before	duty.	Good-night,	dear,	and	don't	worry."

Hilda	saw	him	off,	and	waved	her	hand	from	the	door.	Then	she	went	back slowly	to	the	study	and	looked	round.	She	stood	a	few	moments	and	then switched	off	the	lights,	and	went	out	and	slowly	upstairs.	The	maid	was	in	the bedroom,	and	she	dismissed	her,	keeping	her	face	turned	away.	In	front	of	her glass,	she	held	her	letter	irresolutely	a	moment,	and	then	folded	it	and	slipped	it into	a	drawer.	She	lifted	a	photo	from	the	dressing-table	and	looked	at	it	for	a few	minutes	earnestly.	Then	she	went	to	her	window,	threw	it	up,	and	leaned	on the	sill,	staring	hard	over	the	dark	and	empty	park.

Outside,	the	General	walked	some	distance	before	he	found	a	taxi.	He	walked

fast	for	a	man	of	his	age,	and	ruminated	as	he	went.	It	was	his	way,	and	the	way of	his	kind.	Most	of	the	modern	sciences	left	him	unmoved,	and	although	he would	vehemently	have	denied	it,	he	was	the	most	illogical	of	men.	He	held	fast by	a	few	good,	sound,	old-fashioned	principles,	and	the	process	of	thought,	to him,	meant	turning	over	a	new	thing	until	he	had	got	it	into	line	with	these principles.	It	was	an	excellent	method	as	far	as	it	went,	and	it	made	him	what	he was—a	thoroughly	sound	and	dependable	servant	of	the	State	in	any	routine business.

At	the	War	Office	he	climbed	more	slowly	up	the	steps	and	into	the	lobby.

An	officer	was	just	coming	out,	and	they	recognised	each	other	under	the shaded	lights.	"Hullo,	Chichester,	what	are	you	doing	here?"	demanded Doyle	heartily.	"Thought	you	were	in	France."

"So	I	was,	up	to	yesterday.	I've	just	arrived.	Orders."

"Where	have	you	been?"

"Rouen.	It's	a	big	show	now.	Place	full	of	new	troops	and	mechanics	in	uniform.

To	tell	you	the	truth,	Doyle,	the	Army's	a	different	proposition	from	what	it	was when	you	and	I	were	in	Egypt	and	India.	But	that's	a	long	time	ago,	old	friend."

"Rouen,	eh?	Now,	that's	a	coincidence.	A	young	chap	I	know	has	just	gone	there, in	your	department.	Graham—Peter	Graham.	Remember	him?"

"Oh,	quite	well.	A	very	decent	chap,	I	thought.	Joined	us	ten	days	ago	or	so.

What	about	it?	I	forget	for	the	moment	where	we	put	him."

"Oh,	nothing,	nothing.	He'll	find	his	feet	all	right.	But	what's	this	about	no parade	services	these	days?"

"No	parade	services?	We	have	'em	all	right,	when	we	can.	Of	course,	it	depends a	bit	on	the	O.C.,	and	in	the	Labour	Corps	especially	it	isn't	usually	possible.	It isn't	like	the	line,	old	fellow,	and	even	the	line	isn't	what	we	knew	it.	You	can't have	parade	services	in	trenches,	and	you	can't	have	them	much	when	the	men are	off-loading	bully	beef	or	mending	aeroplanes	and	that	sort	of	thing.	This war's	a	big	proposition,	and	it's	got	to	go	on.	Why?	Young	Graham	grousing?"

"No,	no—oh,	no,"	hastily	asserted	Doyle,	the	soul	of	honour.	"No,	not	at	all.

Only	mentioned	not	getting	a	parade,	and	it	seemed	to	me	a	pity.	There's	a	lot	in

the	good	old	established	religion."

"Is	there?"	said	the	other	thoughtfully.	"I'm	not	so	sure	to-day.	The	men	don't	like being	ordered	to	pray.	They	prefer	to	come	voluntarily."

Doyle	got	fierce.	"Don't	like	being	ordered,	don't	they?	Then	what	the	deuce	are they	there	for?	Good	Lord,	man!	the	Army	isn't	a	debating	society	or	a	mothers'

meeting.	You	might	as	well	have	voluntary	games	at	a	public	school!"

The	A.C.G.	smiled.	"That's	it,	old	headstrong!	No,	my	boy,	the	Army	isn't	a mothers'	meeting—at	any	rate,	Fritz	doesn't	think	so.	But	times	have	changed, and	in	some	ways	they're	better.	I'd	sooner	have	fifty	men	at	a	voluntary	service than	two	hundred	on	a	parade."

"Well,	I	wouldn't,"	exploded	Doyle.	"I	know	your	voluntary	services—Moody and	Sankey	hymns	on	a	Sunday	night.	The	men	had	better	be	in	a	decent	bar.	But turn	'em	out	in	the	morning,	clean	and	decent	on	parade,	and	give	'em	the	old service,	and	it'll	tighten	'em	up	and	do	'em	good.	Voluntary	service!	You'll	have volunteer	evangelists	instead	of	Army	chaplains	next!"

Colonel	Chichester	still	smiled,	but	a	little	grimly.	"We've	got	them,"	he	said.

"And	no	doubt	there's	something	in	what	you	say;	but	times	change,	and	the Church	has	got	to	keep	abreast	of	the	times.	But,	look	here,	I	must	go.	What about	a	luncheon?	I've	not	got	much	leave."

"So	must	I;	I've	an	appointment,"	said	Doyle.	"But	all	right,	old	friend,	to-morrow	at	the	club.	But	you're	younger	than	I,	Chichester,	or	perhaps	you parsons	don't	get	old	as	quickly!"

They	shook	hands	and	parted.	Sir	Robert	was	busy	for	an	hour,	and	came	out again	with	his	head	full	of	the	proposed	plans	for	the	aerial	defence	of	London.

"Taxi,	sir?"	he	was	asked	at	the	door.	"No,"	he	replied;	"I'll	walk	home."

"Best	way	to	think,	walking	at	night,"	he	said	to	himself	as	he	turned	down Whitehall,	through	the	all	but	empty	streets,	darkened	as	they	were.	The meaning	of	those	great	familiar	spaces	struck	him	as	he	walked.	Hardly formulating	it,	he	became	aware	of	a	sense	of	pride	and	responsibility	as	he passed	scene	after	scene	of	England's	past	glory.	The	old	Abbey	towered	up	in the	moonlight,	solemn	and	still,	but	almost	as	if	animate	and	looking	at	him.	He felt	small	and	old	as	he	passed	into	Victoria	Street.	There	the	Stores	by	night made	him	smile	at	the	contrast,	but	in	Ashley	Gardens	Westminster	Cathedral made	him	frown.	If	he	hated	anything,	it	was	that	for	which	it	stood.	Romanism meant	to	him	something	effeminate,	sneaking,	monstrous….	That	there	should be	Englishmen	to	build	such	a	place	positively	angered	him.	He	was	not	exactly a	bigot	or	a	fanatic;	he	would	not	have	repealed	the	Emancipation	Acts;	and	he would	have	said	that	if	anyone	wanted	to	be	a	Romanist,	he	had	better	be	one.

But	he	would	not	have	had	time	for	anyone	who	did	so	want,	and	if	he	should have	had	to	have	by	any	chance	dealings	with	a	priest,	he	would	have	been	so frigidly	polite	that	the	poor	fellow	would	probably	have	been	frozen	solid.	Of course,	Irishmen	were	different,	and	he	had	known	some	capital	fellows,	Irish priests	and	chaplains….

And	then	he	saw	two	men	ahead	of	him.	They	were	privates	on	leave	and	drunk, but	not	hopelessly	drunk.	They	were	trying	to	negotiate	the	blank	of	the	entrance to	the	Catholic	Soldiers'	Hut	in	the	protecting	wall	which	guarded	the	pavement just	beyond	the	cathedral.	As	Sir	Robert	came	within	earshot,	one	of	them stumbled	through	it	and	collapsed	profanely.	He	halted	for	a	second	irresolutely, with	the	officer's	hesitancy	at	meddling	with	a	drunken	man.

The	fellow	on	the	ground	tried	to	raise	himself,	and	got	one	elbow	on	the	gravel.

This	brought	him	into	such	a	position	that	he	stared	straight	at	the	illuminated crucifix	across	the	path,	and	but	little	farther	in.

"Lor',	blimey,	Joe,"	he	said,	"I'm	blasted	drunk,	I	am!	Thought	I	was	in	old Wipers,	I	did,	and	see	one	of	them	blessed	cru-crushifixes!"

The	other,	rather	less	away,	pulled	at	his	arm.	"So	yer	did,	ole	pal,"	he	said.	"It's there	now.	This	'ere's	some	Cartholic	place	or	other.	Come	 hon."

"Strike	me	dead,	so	it	is,	Joe,	large	as	life!	Christ!	oo'd	'ave	thought	it?	A	bloody cru-cru-chifix!	Wat's	old	England	comin'	to,	Joe?"	And	with	drunken	solemnity he	began	to	make	a	sign	of	the	cross,	as	he	had	seen	it	done	in	Belgium.

The	other,	in	the	half-light,	plainly	started.	"Shut	your	bloody	jaw,	'Enery,"	he said,	"It's	bad	luck	to	swear	near	a	cruchifix.	I	saw	three	chaps	blotted	out	clean next	second	for	it,	back	behind	Lar	Basay.	Come	on,	will	yer?	We	carn't	stay	'ere all	the	blasted	night."

"You	are	down	on	a	chap,	you	are,"	said	the	other.	" Hi	don't	mean	no	'arm.	' E

ought	to	know	that,	any'ow."	He	got	unsteadily	to	his	feet.	"'E	died	to	save	us,	'E

did.	I	'eard	a	Y.M.C.A.	bloke	say	them	very	words,	'E	died	on	the	cru-cru-chifix to	save	us."

"'Ere,	cheese	it,	you	fool!	We'll	have	somebody	out	next.	Come	away	with	yer.

I've	got	some	Bass	in	my	place,	if	we	git	there."

At	this	the	other	consented	to	come.	Together	they	staggered	out,	not	seeing	Sir Robert,	and	went	off	down	the	street,	"'Enery"	talking	as	they	went.	The	General stood	and	listened	as	the	man's	voice	died	down.

"Good	for	yer,	old	pal.	But	'E	died	to	save	us	 hall,	'E	did.	Made	a	bloomer	of	it,	I reckon.	Didn't	save	us	from	the	bloody	trenches—not	as	I	can	see,	any'ow.	If	that chap	could	'ave	told	us	'ow	to	get	saved	from	the	blasted	rats	an'	bugs	an'…."

Sir	Robert	pulled	himself	together	and	walked	away	sharply.	By	the	cathedral	the carven	Christ	hung	on	in	the	wan	yellow	light,	very	still.





CHAPTER	V

Peter	lay	on	a	home-made	bed	between	the	blankets	and	contemplated	the ceiling	while	he	smoked	his	first	cigarette.	He	had	been	a	fortnight	at	Rouen,	and he	was	beginning	to	feel	an	old	soldier—that	is	to	say,	he	was	learning	not	to worry	too	much	about	outside	things,	and	not	to	show	he	worried	particularly about	the	interior.	He	was	learning	to	stand	around	and	smoke	endless	cigarettes; to	stroll	in	to	breakfast	and	out	again,	look	over	a	paper,	sniff	the	air,	write	a letter,	read	another	paper,	wander	round	the	camp,	talk	a	lot	of	rubbish	and	listen to	more,	and	so	do	a	morning's	work.	Occasionally	he	took	a	service,	but	his	real job	was,	as	mess	secretary,	to	despatch	the	man	to	town	for	the	shopping	and afterwards	go	and	settle	the	bills.	Just	at	present	he	was	wondering	sleepily whether	to	continue	ordering	fish	from	the	big	merchants,	Biais	Frères	et	Cie,	or to	go	down	to	the	market	and	choose	it	for	himself.	It	was	a	very	knotty	problem, because	solving	it	in	the	latter	way	meant	getting	up	at	once.	And	his	batman	had not	yet	brought	his	tea.

There	came	a	knock	at	the	door,	and	the	tea	came	in.	With	it	was	a	folded	note.

"Came	last	night,	sir,	but	you	was	out,"	said	the	man.	He	collected	his	master's tunic	and	boots,	and	departed.

Peter	opened	the	note	and	swore	definitely	and	unclerically	when	he	had	read	it.

It	was	from	some	unknown	person,	who	signed	himself	as	Acting	Assistant Chaplain-General,	to	the	effect	that	he	was	to	be	moved	to	another	base,	and	that as	the	A.C.G.	was	temporarily	on	leave,	he	had	better	apply	to	the	Colonel	of	his own	group	for	the	necessary	movement	order.	On	the	whole	this	was unintelligible	to	Peter,	but	he	was	already	learning	that	there	was	no	need	to worry	about	that,	for	somebody	would	be	able	to	read	the	riddle.	What	annoyed him	was	the	fact	that	he	had	got	to	move	just	as	he	was	settling	down.	It	was certainly	a	matter	for	another	cigarette,	and	as	he	lit	it	he	perceived	one	gleam	of sunshine:	he	need	worry	no	more	about	the	fish.

Peter	waited	till	Harold	had	finished	his	breakfast	before	he	imparted	the	news	to the	world	a	couple	of	hours	or	so	later.	"I	say,	skipper,"	he	said,	"I've	got	to	quit."

"What,	padre?	Oh,	hang	it	all,	no,	man!	You've	only	just	taken	on	the	mess secretary's	job,	and	you	aren't	doing	it	any	too	badly	either.	You	can't	go,	old dear."

"I	must.	Some	blighter's	written	from	the	A.C.G.'s	office,	and	I've	got	to	get	a movement	order	from	the	Colonel	of	the	group,	whatever	that	means.	But	I suppose	you	can	put	me	straight	about	that,	anyway."

"Sure	thing.	Come	up	to	the	orderly-room	'bout	eleven,	and	you	can	fill	up	the chit	and	I'll	fire	it	in	for	you.	It's	only	a	matter	of	form.	It	goes	through	to Colonel	Lear	at	La	Croisset.	Where	to?"

Peter	told	him	moodily.

"Eh?"	said	Harold.	"Well,	you	can	cheer	up	about	that.	Havre's	not	at	all	a	bad place.	There	are	some	decent	shows	about	there	and	some	very	decent	people.

What	you	got	to	do?"

"I	don't	know;	I	suppose	I	shall	find	out	when	I	get	there.	But	I	don't	care	what it's	like.	It's	vile	having	to	leave	just	now,	when	I'm	getting	straight.	And	what'll you	do	for	a	four	at	bridge?"

Harold	got	up	and	fumbled	in	his	pockets.	As	usual,	there	was	nothing	there.

"Why	that	damned	batman	of	mine	won't	put	my	case	in	my	pocket	I	can't think,"	he	said.	"I'll	have	to	fire	the	blighter,	though	he	is	T.T.	and	used	to	be	a	P.

and	O.	steward.	Give	me	a	fag,	somebody.	Thanks.	Well,	padre,	it's	no	use grousing.	It's	a	beastly	old	war,	and	you're	in	the	blinkin'	British	Army,	me	lad.

Drop	in	at	eleven,	then.	Cheerio	till	then."

At	eleven	Peter	found	Harold	signing	papers.	He	glanced	up.	"Oh,	sergeant,"	he said,	"give	Captain	Graham	a	Movement	Order	Application	Form,	will	you?	Sit down,	padre;	there's	a	pen	there."

Peter	wrestled	with	the	form,	which	looked	quite	pretty	when	it	was	done.

Harold	endorsed	it.	"Fire	this	through	to	the	orderly-room,	10th	Group, sergeant,"	he	said,	and	rose	wearily.	"Come	along,	padre,"	he	said:	"I've	got	to	go round	the	camp,	and	you	can	come	too,	if	you've	nothing	better	to	do."

"When'll	I	have	to	go,	do	you	think?"	asked	Peter	as	they	went	out.

"Oh,	I	don't	know.	In	a	day	or	two.	You'll	have	to	hang	about,	for	the	order	may come	any	time,	and	I	don't	know	how	or	when	they'll	send	you."

Peter	did	hang	about,	for	ten	days,	with	his	kit	packed.	His	recently	acquired calm	forsook	him	about	the	sixth	day,	and	on	the	tenth	he	was	entirely	mutinous.

At	lunch	he	voiced	his	grievances	to	the	general	mess.

"Look	here,	you	men,"	he	said,	"I'm	fed	up	to	the	back	teeth.	I've	hung	round	this blessed	camp	for	more	than	a	week	waiting	for	that	infernal	movement	order, and	I'm	hanged	if	I'm	going	to	stay	in	any	more.	It's	a	topping	afternoon.	Who'll come	down	the	river	to	La	Bouille,	or	whatever	it	is	called?"

Harold	volunteered.	"That's	a	good	line,	padre.	I	want	to	go	there	myself.	Are	the boats	running	now?"

"Saw	'em	yesterday,"	volunteered	somebody,	and	it	was	settled.

The	two	of	them	spent	a	decent	afternoon	on	the	river,	and	at	Harold's	insistence went	on	back	right	up	to	town.	They	dined	and	went	to	a	cinema,	and	got	back	to camp	about	midnight.	Graham	struck	a	match	and	looked	at	the	board	in	the anteroom.	"May	as	well	see	if	there	is	anything	for	me,"	he	said.	There	was,	of course.	He	tore	the	envelope	open.	"Good	Lord,	skipper!"	he	said.	"Here's	my blessed	movement	order,	to	report	at	the	Gare	du	Vert	at	eight	p.m.	this	very	day.

I'm	only	four	hours	too	late.	What	the	dickens	shall	I	do?"

Harold	whistled.	"Show	it	me,"	he	said.	"'The	following	personnel	to	report	at Gare	du	Vert	…	at	8	p.m.	28th	inst'"	he	read.	"You're	for	it,	old	bird,"	he continued	cheerfully.	"But	what	rot!	Look	here,	it	was	handed	in	to	my	orderly-room	at	six-thirty.	You'd	have	hardly	had	time	to	get	there	at	any	rate."

Graham	looked	over	his	shoulder.	"That's	so,"	he	said.	"But	what'll	I	do	now?"

"Haven't	a	notion,"	said	the	other,	"except	that	they'll	let	you	know	quick enough.	Don't	worry—that's	the	main	thing.	If	they	choke	you	off,	tell	'em	it came	too	late	to	get	to	the	station."

Peter	meditated	this	in	silence,	and	in	some	dismay.	He	saw	visions	of	courts-martial,	furious	strafing,	and	unholy	terrors.	He	was	to	be	forgiven,	for	he	was

new	to	comic	opera;	and	besides,	when	a	page	of	 Punch	falls	to	one	in	real	life, one	hardly	realises	it	till	too	late.	But	it	was	plain	that	nothing	could	be	done	that night,	and	he	went	to	bed	with	what	consolation	he	could	derive	from	the cheerful	Harold.

Next	morning	his	breakfast	was	hardly	over	when	an	orderly	came	in.	Harold had	been	earlier	than	usual,	and	had	finished	and	gone	out.	"Captain	Graham, sir?"	queried	the	man.	"Captain	Harold's	compliments,	and	a	telephone	message has	just	come	in	that	you	are	to	report	to	H.Q.	10th	Group	as	quickly	as possible."

Peter	brushed	himself	up,	and	outwardly	cheerful	but	inwardly	quaking,	set	off.

Half	an	hour's	walk	brought	him	to	the	place,	a	little	office	near	a	wharf	in	a tangle	of	trolley	lines.	He	knocked,	went	in,	came	to	attention,	and	saluted.

Colonel	Lear	was	a	short,	red-faced,	boorish	fellow,	and	his	Adjutant	sat	beside him	at	the	desk,	for	the	Colonel	was	not	particularly	well	up	in	his	job.	The Adjutant	was	tall,	slightly	bald,	and	fat-faced,	and	he	leaned	back	throughout	the interview	with	an	air	of	sneering	boredom,	only	vouchsafing	laconic	replies	to his	superior's	occasional	questions.	Peter	didn't	know	which	he	hated	the	more; but	he	concluded	that	whereas	he	would	like	to	cut	the	Colonel	in	Regent	Street, he	would	enjoy	shooting	the	Adjutant.

"Ah!"	said	the	Colonel.	"Are	you	Captain	Graham?	Well,	sir,	what's	the	meaning of	this?	You	applied	for	a	movement	order,	and	one	was	sent	you,	and	you	did not	report	at	the	station.	You	damned	padres	think	you	can	do	any	bally	thing you	choose!	Out	here	for	a	picnic,	I	suppose.	What	is	the	meaning	of	it?"

"Well,	sir,"	said	Peter,	"I	waited	ten	days	for	the	order	and	it	did	not	come.	At last	I	went	out	for	the	afternoon,	and	got	back	too	late	to	execute	it.	I'm	very sorry,	but	can't	I	go	to-day	instead?"

"Good	God,	sir!	do	you	think	the	whole	British	Army	is	arranged	for	your benefit?	Do	you	think	nobody	has	anything	else	to	do	except	to	arrange	things	to suit	your	convenience?	We	haven't	got	troopers	with	Pullman	cars	every	day	for the	advantage	of	you	chaplains,	though	I	suppose	you	think	we	ought	to	have.

Supposing	you	did	have	to	wait,	what	about	it?	What	else	have	you	to	do?	You'd have	waited	fast	enough	if	it	was	an	order	to	go	on	leave;	that's	about	all	you parsons	think	about. I	don't	know	what	you	can	do.	What	had	he	better	do,

Mallony?"

The	Adjutant	leaned	forward	leisurely,	surveying	Peter	coolly.

"Probably	he'd	better	report	to	the	R.T.O.,	sir,"	he	said.

"Oh,	very	well.	It	won't	be	any	good,	though.	Go	up	to	the	R.T.O.	and	ask	him what	you	can	do.	Here's	the	order."	(He	threw	it	across	the	table,	and	Peter picked	it	up,	noting	miserably	the	blue	legend,	"Failed	to	Report—R.T.O.,	Gare du	Vert.")	"But	don't	apply	to	this	office	again.	Haven't	you	got	a	blessed department	to	do	your	own	damned	dirty	work?"

"The	A.C.G.'s	away,	sir,"	said	Peter.

"On	leave,	I	suppose.	Wish	to	God	I	were	a	padre,	eh,	Mallony?	Always	on	leave or	in	Paris,	and	doin'	nothing	in	between….	Got	those	returns,	sergeant?…	What in	hell	are	you	waiting	for,	padre?"

For	the	first	time	in	his	life	Peter	had	an	idea	of	what	seeing	red	really	means.

But	he	mastered	it	by	an	effort,	saluted	without	a	word,	and	passed	out.

In	a	confused	whirl	he	set	off	for	the	R.T.O.,	and	with	a	sinking	heart	reached	the station,	crowded	with	French	peasantry,	who	had	apparently	come	for	the	day	to wait	for	the	train.	Big	notices	made	it	impossible	to	miss	the	Railway	Transport Officer.	He	passed	down	a	passage	and	into	an	office.	He	loathed	and	hated	the whole	wide	world	as	he	went	in.

A	young	man,	smoking	a	cigarette	and	reading	a	magazine,	glanced	up	at	him.

Peter	observed	in	time	that	he	had	two	stars	only	on	his	shoulder-strap.	Before	he could	speak,	the	other	said	cheerily:	"Well,	padre,	and	what	can	I	do	for	you?"

Peter	deprecatingly	told	him.	He	had	waited	ten	days,	etc.,	and	had	at	last	gone out,	and	the	movement	order	had	come	with…

The	other	cut	him	short:	"Oh,	you're	the	chap	who	failed	to	report,	are	you?

Blighted	rotters	they	are	at	these	Group	H.Q.'s.	Chuck	us	over	the	chit."

Peter	brightened	up	and	obeyed.	The	other	read	it.	"I	know,"	ventured	Peter,	"but I	got	the	dickens	of	a	strafe	from	the	Colonel.	He	said	he	had	no	idea	when	I could	get	away,	and	had	better	see	you.	What	can	I	do?"

"Silly	old	ass!	You'd	better	go	to-night.	There	are	plenty	of	trains,	and	you're	all alone,	aren't	you?	I	might	just	alter	the	date,	but	I	suppose	now	you	had	better	go to	his	nibs	the	Deputy	Assistant	Officer	controlling	Transport.	He's	in	the	Rue	de la	Republique,	No.	153;	you	can	find	it	easily	enough.	Tell	him	I	sent	you.	He'll probably	make	you	out	a	new	order."

Peter	felt	enormously	relieved.	He	relaxed,	smiled,	and	got	out	a	cigarette, offering	the	other	one.	"Beastly	lot	of	fuss	they	make	over	nothing,	these	chaps,"

he	said.

"I	know,"	said	the	R.T.O.;	"but	they're	paid	for	it,	my	boy,	and	probably	your	old dear	had	been	strafed	himself	this	morning.	Well,	cheerio;	see	you	again	to-night.	Come	in	time,	and	I'll	get	you	a	decent	place."

The	great	man's	office	was	up	two	flights	of	wooden	stairs	in	what	looked	like	a deserted	house.	But	Peter	mounted	them	with	an	easy	mind.	He	had	forgiven Lear,	and	the	world	smiled.	He	still	didn't	realise	he	was	acting	in	 Punch.

Outside	a	suitably	labelled	door	he	stood	a	moment,	listening	to	a	well-bred voice	drawling	out	sarcastic	orders	to	some	unfortunate.	Then,	with	a	smile	he entered.	A	Major	looked	up	at	him,	and	heard	his	story	without	a	word.	Peter	got less	buoyant	as	he	proceeded,	and	towards	the	end	he	was	rather	lame.	A	silence followed.	The	great	man	scrutinised	the	order.	"Where	were	you?"	he	demanded at	last,	abruptly.

It	was	an	awkward	question.	Peter	hedged.	"The	O.C.	of	my	camp	asked	me	to go	out	with	him,"	he	said	at	last,	feebly.

The	other	picked	up	a	blue	pencil	and	scrawled	further	on	the	order.	"We've	had too	much	of	this	lately,"	he	said	icily.	"Officers	appear	to	think	they	can	travel when	and	how	they	please.	You	will	report	to	the	D.A.Q.M.G.	at	Headquarters, 3rd	Echelon."	He	handed	the	folded	order	back,	and	the	miserable	Peter	had	a notion	that	he	meant	to	add:	"And	God	have	mercy	on	your	soul."

He	ventured	a	futile	remonstrance.	"The	R.T.O.	said	you	could	perhaps	alter	the date."

The	Major	leaned	back	and	regarded	him	in	silence	as	a	remarkable	phenomenon such	as	had	not	previously	come	his	way.	Then	he	sighed,	and	picked	up	a	pen.

"Good-morning,"	he	said.

Peter,	in	the	street,	contemplated	many	things,	including	suicide.	If	Colonel Chichester	had	been	in	Rouen	he	would	have	gone	there;	as	it	was,	he	did	not dare	to	face	that	unknown	any	more	than	this	other.	In	the	end	he	set	out	slowly for	H.Q.,	was	saluted	by	the	sentry	under	the	flag,	climbed	up	to	a	corridor	with many	strangely	labelled	doors,	and	finally	entered	the	right	one,	to	find	himself in	a	big	room	in	which	half	a	dozen	men	in	uniform	were	engaged	at	as	many desks	with	orderlies	moving	between	them.	A	kind	of	counter	barred	his	farther passage.	He	stood	at	it	forlornly	for	a	few	minutes.

At	last	an	orderly	came	to	him,	and	he	shortly	explained	his	presence	and	handed in	the	much-blued	order.	The	man	listened	in	silence,	asked	him	to	wait	a moment,	and	departed.	Peter	leaned	on	the	counter	and	tried	to	look	indifferent.

With	a	detached	air	he	studied	the	Kirschner	girls	on	the	walls.	These	added	a certain	air	to	the	otherwise	forlorn	place,	but	when,	a	little	later,	W.A.A.C.'s	were installed,	a	paternal	Government	ordered	their	removal.	But	that	then	mattered no	longer	to	Peter.

At	the	last	the	orderly	came	back.	"Will	you	please	follow	me,	sir?"	he	said.

Peter	was	led	round	the	barrier	like	a	sheep	to	execution,	and	in	at	a	small	door.

He	espied	a	General	Officer	at	a	desk	by	the	window,	telephone	receiver	in	one hand,	the	fateful	order	in	the	other.	He	saluted.	The	other	nodded.	Peter	waited.

"Ah,	yes!	D.A.Q.M.G.	speaking.	That	10th	Group	Headquarters?	Oh	yes;	good-morning,	Mallony.	About	Captain	Graham's	movement	order.	When	was	this order	applied	for	at	your	end?…	What?	Eighteenth?	Humph!	What	time	did	your office	receive	it?…	Eh?	Ten	a.m.?	Then,	sir,	I	should	like	to	know	what	it	was doing	in	your	office	till	six	p.m.	This	officer	did	not	receive	it	till	six-thirty.

What?	He	was	out?	Yes,	very	likely,	but	it	reached	his	mess	at	six-thirty:	it	is	so endorsed….	Colonel	Lear	has	had	the	matter	under	consideration?	Good.	Kindly ask	Colonel	Lear	to	come	to	the	telephone."

He	leaned	back,	and	glanced	up	at	Graham,	taking	him	in	with	a	grave	smile.	"I understand	you	waited	ten	days	for	this,	Captain	Graham,"	he	said.	"It's disgraceful	that	it	should	happen.	I	am	glad	to	have	had	an	instance	brought before	me,	as	we	have	had	too	many	cases	of	this	sort	of	thing	lately…."	He broke	off.	"Yes?	Colonel	Lear?	Ah,	good-morning,	Colonel	Lear.	This	case	of the	movement	order	of	Captain	Graham	has	just	been	brought	to	me.	This	officer was	kept	waiting	ten	days	for	his	order,	and	then	given	an	impossibly	short	time

to	report.	Well,	it	won't	do,	Colonel.	There	must	be	something	very	wrong	in your	orderly-room;	kindly	see	to	it.	Chaplains	have	other	things	to	do	than	sit around	in	camps	waiting	the	convenience	of	Group	Headquarters.	The application	for	this	order	reached	us	on	the	27th,	and	was	sent	off	early	next morning,	in	ample	time	for	the	officer	to	travel.	I	am	very	displeased	about	it.

You	will	kindly	apply	at	once	for	a	fresh	order,	and	see	that	it	is	in	Captain Graham's	hands	at	least	six	hours	before	he	must	report.	That	is	all.	Good-morning."

Peter	could	hardly	believe	his	ears,	but	he	could	barely	keep	a	straight	face either.	The	D.A.Q.M.G.	hung	up	the	receiver	and	repeated	the	latter	part	of	the message.	Peter	thanked	him	and	departed,	walking	on	air.	A	day	later	an	orderly from	the	group	informed	him	at	11	a.m.	that	the	order	had	been	applied	for	and might	be	expected	that	day,	and	at	1	o'clock	he	received	it.	Such	is	the	humour	of the	high	gods	who	control	the	British	Army.	But	he	never	saw	Colonel	Lear again,	and	was	thankful.

Peter	reached	his	new	base,	then,	early	in	March	in	a	drizzle	of	rain.	He	was	told his	camp	and	set	off	to	find	it,	and	for	an	hour	walked	through	endless	docks, over	innumerable	bridges,	several	of	which,	being	open	to	admit	and	let	out ships,	caused	him	pretty	considerable	delay.	It	was	a	strange,	new	experience.

The	docks	presented	types	of	nearly	every	conceivable	nationality	and	of	every sort	of	shipping.	French	marines	and	seamen	were,	of	course	everywhere,	but	so were	Chinese,	South	African	natives,	Egyptians,	Senegalese,	types	of	all European	nationalities,	a	few	of	the	first	clean,	efficient-looking	Americans	in tight-fitting	uniforms,	and	individual	officers	of	a	score	of	regiments.

The	old	town	ended	in	a	row	of	high,	disreputable-looking	houses	that	were, however,	picturesque	enough,	and	across	the	 pavé	in	front	of	them	commenced the	docks.	One	walked	in	and	out	of	harbours	and	waterways,	the	main	stretch	of harbour	opening	up	more	and	more	on	the	right	hand,	and	finally	showing	two great	encircling	arms	that	nearly	met,	and	the	grey	Channel	beyond.	Tossing	at anchor	outside	were	more	than	a	dozen	ships,	waiting	for	dark	to	attempt	the crossing.	As	he	went,	a	seaplane	came	humming	in	from	the	mists,	circled	the old	town,	and	took	the	harbour	water	in	a	slither	of	foam.	He	had	to	wait	while	a big	Argentine	ship	ploughed	slowly	in	up	a	narrow	channel,	and	then,	in	the	late afternoon,	crossed	a	narrow	swing	foot-bridge,	and	found	himself	on	the	main outer	sea-wall.

Following	directions,	he	turned	to	the	right	and	walked	as	if	going	out	to	the harbour	mouth	a	mile	or	so	ahead.	It	seemed	impossible	that	his	camp	should	be here,	for	on	the	one	hand	he	was	close	to	the	harbour,	and	on	the	other,	over	a high	wall	and	some	buildings,	was	plainly	to	be	espied	the	sea.	A	few	hundred yards	on,	however,	a	crowd	of	Tommies	were	lined	up	and	passing	embarkation officers	for	a	big	trooper,	and	Peter	concluded	that	this	was	the	leave	boat	by which	he	was	to	mark	his	camp	across	the	road	and	more	or	less	beyond	it.

He	crossed	a	railway-line,	went	in	at	a	gate,	and	was	there.

The	officers'	quarters	had	a	certain	fascination.	You	stepped	out	of	the	anteroom and	found	yourself	on	a	raised	concrete	platform	at	the	back	of	which	washed the	sea.	Very	extensive	harbour	works,	half	completed,	ran	farther	out	in	a	great semicircle	across	a	wide	space	of	leaden	water,	over	which	gulls	were	circling and	crying;	but	the	thin	black	line	of	this	wall	hardly	interrupted	one's	sense	of looking	straight	out	to	sea,	and	its	wide	mouth	away	on	the	right	let	in	the	real invigorating,	sea-smelling	wind.	The	camp	itself	was	a	mere	strip	between	the railway-line	and	the	water,	a	camp	of	R.E.'s	to	which	he	was	attached.	He	was also	to	work	a	hospital	which	was	said	to	be	close	by.

It	was	pointed	out	to	him	later.	The	railway	ran	out	all	but	to	the	harbour	mouth, and	there	ended	in	a	great	covered,	wide	station.	Above	it,	large	and	airy,	with extensive	verandahs	parallel	to	the	harbour,	was	the	old	Customs,	and	it	was	this that	had	been	transformed	into	a	hospital.	It	was	an	admirable	place.	The	Red Cross	trains	ran	in	below,	and	the	men	could	be	quickly	swung	up	into	the	cool, clean	wards	above.	These,	all	on	one	level,	had	great	glass	doors	giving	access	to the	verandahs,	and	from	the	verandahs	broad	gangways	could	be	placed,	running men,	at	high	tide,	on	to	the	hospital	ship	alongside.	The	nurses'	quarters	were beyond,	and	their	sitting-room	was	perched	up,	as	it	were,	sea	on	one	side	and harbour	on	the	other.

At	present,	of	course,	Peter	did	not	know	all	this.	He	was	merely	conducted	by an	orderly	in	the	dusk	to	the	anteroom	of	the	mess,	and	welcomed	by	the orderly-officer,	who	led	him	into	a	comfortable	room	already	lit,	in	a	corner	of which,	near	a	stove,	four	officers	sat	at	cards.

"Hearts	three,"	said	one	as	Peter	came	in.

"Pass	me,"	said	another,	and	it	struck	Peter	that	he	knew	the	tone.

The	four	were	fairly	absorbed	in	their	game,	but	the	orderly	officer	led	Peter towards	the	table.	At	that	they	looked	up,	and	next	minute	one	had	jumped	up and	was	greeting	him.

"By	all	that's	wonderful!	It's	you	again,"	he	said.

"Donovan!"	exclaimed	Peter,	"What:	are	you	doing	here?"

The	South	African	held	out	his	hand.	"I've	got	attached	to	one	of	our	nigger outfits,"	he	said,	"just	up	the	dock	from	here.	But	what	are	you	doing?"

"Oh,	I've	been	moved	from	Rouen,"	said	Peter,	"and	told	to	join	up	here.	Got	to look	after	the	hospital	and	a	few	camps.	And	I	was	told,"	he	added,	"I'd	live	in this	camp."

"Good	enough,"	said	Donovan.	"Let	me	introduce	you.	This	is	Lieutenant Pennell,	R.E.—Lieutenant	Pennell,	Captain	Graham.	This	is	a	bird	of	your kidney,	mess	secretary	and	a	great	man,	Padre	Arnold,	and	this	is	one	Ferrars, Australian	Infantry.	He	tried	to	stop	a	shell,"	went	on	Donovan	easily,	"and	is now	recovering.	The	shock	left	him	a	little	insane,	or	so	his	best	friends	think; hence,	as	you	may	have	heard,	he	has	just	gone	three	hearts.	And	that's	all anyone	can	do	at	present,	padre,	so	have	a	cigarette	and	sit	down.	I	hope	you haven't	changed	your	old	habits,	as	you	are	just	in	time	for	a	sun-downer.

Orderly!"

He	pulled	up	a	large	easy-chair,	and	Peter	subsided	into	it	with	a	pleasant	feeling of	welcome.	He	remembered,	now,	having	heard	that	Donovan	was	at	Havre,	but it	was	none	the	less	a	surprise	to	meet	him.

Donovan	played	a	good	hand	when	he	liked,	but	when	he	was	not	meeting	his mettle,	or	perhaps	when	the	conditions	were	not	serious	enough,	he	usually	kept up	a	diverting,	unorthodox	run	of	talk	the	whole	time.	Peter	listened	and	took	in his	surroundings	lazily.	"Come	on,"	said	his	friend,	playing	a	queen.	"Shove	on your	king,	Pennell;	everyone	knows	you've	got	him.	What?	Hiding	the	old gentleman,	are	you?	Why,	sure	it's	myself	has	him	all	the	time"—gathering	up the	trick	and	leading	the	king.	"Perhaps	somebody's	holding	up	the	ace	now…."

and	so	on.

Pennell	played	well	too,	but	very	differently.	He	was	usually	bored	with	his	luck or	the	circumstances,	and	until	you	got	to	know	him	you	were	inclined	to	think

he	was	bored	with	you.	He	was	a	young-looking	man	of	thirty-five,	rather	good-looking,	an	engineer	in	peace-time	who	had	knocked	about	the	world	a	good deal,	but	hardly	gave	you	that	impression.	The	Australian	played	poorly.	With curly	dark	hair	and	a	perpetual	pipe,	his	face	was	almost	sullen	in	repose,	but	it lit	up	eagerly	enough	at	any	chance	excitement.	Arnold	was	easily	the	eldest,	a short	man	with	iron-grey	hair	and	very	kindly	eyes,	a	man	master	of	himself	and his	circumstances.	Peter	watched	him	eagerly.	He	was	likely	to	see	a	good	deal of	him,	he	thought,	and	he	was	glad	there	would	be	a	padre	as	well	in	camp.

Donovan	and	Ferrars	won	the	game	and	so	the	rubber	easily,	and	the	former pushed	his	chair	back	from	the	table.	"That's	enough	for	me,	boys,"	he	said.	"I must	trek	in	a	minute.	Well,	padre,	and	what	do	you	think	of	the	Army	now?"

"Mixed	biscuits	rather,"	Peter	said.	"But	I	had	a	rum	experience	getting	here.

You	wouldn't	have	thought	it	possible,"	and	he	related	the	story	of	the	movement order.	At	the	close,	Pennell	nodded	gloomily.	"Pack	of	fools	they	are!"	he	said.

"Hardly	one	of	them	knows	his	job.	You	can	thank	your	lucky	stars	that	the D.A.Q.M.G.	had	a	down	on	that	Colonel	What's-his-name,	or	it	would	have taken	you	another	month	to	get	here,	probably—eh,	Donovan?"

"That's	so,	old	dear,"	said	that	worthy,	"But	I'm	hanged	if	I'd	have	cared.	Some place,	Rouen.	Better'n	this	hole."

"Well,	at	Rouen	they	said	this	was	better,"	said	Peter.

Arnold	laughed.	"That's	the	way	of	the	Army,"	he	said.	"It's	all	much	the	same, but	you	would	have	to	go	far	to	beat	this	camp."

Pennell	agreed.	"You're	right	there,	padre,"	he	said.	"This	is	as	neat	a	hole	as	I've struck.	If	you	know	the	road,"	he	went	on	to	Peter,	"you	can	slip	into	town	in twenty-five	minutes	or	so,	and	we're	much	better	placed	than	most	camps.

There's	no	mud	and	cinders	here,	is	there,	Donovan?	His	camp's	built	on cinders,"	he	added.

"There	are	not,"	said	that	worthy,	rising.	"And	you're	very	convenient	to	the hospital	here,	padre.	You	better	get	Arnold	to	show	you	round;	he's	a	dog	with the	nurses."

"What	about	the	acting	matron,	No.	1	Base?"	demanded	Arnold.	"He	has	tea there	every	Sunday,"	he	explained	to	Peter,	"and	he	a	married	man,	too."

"It's	time	I	went,"	said	Donovan,	laughing;	"all	the	same,	there's	a	concert	on Tuesday	in	next	week,	a	good	one,	I	believe,	and	I've	promised	to	go	and	take some	people.	Who'll	come?	Pennell,	will	you?"

"Not	this	child,	thanks.	Too	many	nurses,	too	much	tea,	and	too	much	talk	for me.	Now,	if	you	would	pick	me	out	a	pretty	one	and	fix	up	a	little	dinner	in town,	I'm	your	man,	old	bean."

"Well,	that	might	be	managed.	It's	time	we	had	a	flutter	of	some	sort.	I'll	see.

What	about	you,	Graham?	You	game	to	try	the	hospital?	You'll	have	to	get	to know	the	ropes	of	them	all,	you	know."

"Yes,	I'll	come,"	said	Peter—"if	I	can,	that	is."	He	looked	inquiringly	at	Arnold.

"Oh,	your	time	is	more	or	less	your	own,"	he	replied—"at	least,	it	is	our	side	of the	house.	Are	you	C.G.	or	P.C.?"

"Good	God,	padre!"	said	the	Australian,	getting	up	too,	"what	in	the	world	do you	mean?"

"Chaplain-General's	Department	or	Principal	Chaplain's	Department,	Church	of England	or	Nonconformist.	And	it's	sixpence	a	swear	in	this	mess."	Arnold	held out	a	hand.

Donovan	caught	his	friend	by	the	arm.	"Come	on	out	of	it,"	he	said.	"You	won't get	back	in	time	if	you	don't.	The	padre's	a	good	sort;	you	needn't	mind	him.	So long	everybody.	Keep	Tuesday	clear,	Graham.	I'll	call	for	you."

"Well,	I'd	better	fix	you	up,	Graham,"	said	Arnold.	"For	my	sins	I'm	mess secretary,	and	as	the	president's	out	and	likely	to	be,	I'll	find	a	place	for	you."

He	led	Peter	into	the	passage,	and	consulted	a	board	on	the	wall.	"I'd	like	to	put you	next	me,	but	I	can't,"	he	said.	"Both	sides	occupied.	Wait	a	minute.	No.	10

Pennell,	and	No.	11's	free.	How	would	you	like	that?	Pennell,"	he	called	through the	open	door,	"what's	the	next	room	to	yours	like?	Light	all	right?"

"Quite	decent,"	said	Pennell,	coming	to	the	door.	"Going	to	put	him	there,	padre?

Let's	go	and	see."	Then	the	three	went	off	together	down	the	passage.

The	little	room	was	bare,	except	for	a	table	under	the	window,	Arnold	opened	it,

and	Peter	saw	he	looked	out	over	the	sea.	Pennell	switched	on	the	light	and found	it	working	correctly,	and	then	sauntered	across	the	couple	of	yards	or	so	of the	cubicle's	width	to	look	at	the	remains	of	some	coloured	pictures	pasted	on	the wooden	partition.

"Last	man's	made	a	little	collection	from	 La	Vie	Parisienne	for	you,	padre,"	he said,	"Not	a	very	bright	selection,	either.	You'll	have	to	cover	them	up,	or	it'll never	do	to	bring	your	A.C.G.	or	A.P.C.,	or	whatever	he	is,	in	here.	What	a	life!"

he	added,	regarding	them.	"They	are	a	queer	people,	the	French….	Well,	is	this going	to	do?"

Graham	glanced	at	Arnold,	"Very	well,"	he	said,	"if	it's	all	right	for	me	to	have it."

"Quite	all	right,"	said	Arnold.	"Remember,	Pennell	is	next	door	left,	so	keep	him in	order.	Next	door	right	is	the	English	Channel,	more	or	less.	Now,	what	about your	traps?"

"I	left	them	outside	the	orderly-room,"	said	Peter,	"except	for	some	that	a	porter was	to	bring	up.	Perhaps	they'll	be	here	by	now.	I've	got	a	stretcher	and	so	on."

"I'll	go	and	see,"	said	Pennell,	"and	I'll	put	my	man	on	to	get	you	straight,	as	you haven't	a	batman	yet."	And	he	strolled	off.

"Come	to	my	room	a	minute,"	said	Arnold,	and	Peter	followed	him.

Arnold's	room	was	littered	with	stuff.	The	table	was	spread	with	mess	accounts, and	the	corners	of	the	little	place	were	stacked	up	with	a	gramophone,	hymn-books,	lantern-slides,	footballs,	boxing-gloves,	and	such-like.	The	chairs	were both	littered,	but	Arnold	cleared	one	by	the	simple	expedient	of	piling	all	its contents	on	the	other,	and	motioned	his	visitor	to	sit	down.	"Have	a	pipe?"	he asked,	holding	out	his	pouch.

Peter	thanked	him,	filled	and	handed	it	back,	then	lit	his	pipe,	and	glanced curiously	round	the	room	as	he	drew	on	it.	"You're	pretty	full	up,"	he	said.

"Fairly,"	said	the	other.	"There's	a	Y.M.C.A.	here,	and	I	run	it	more	or	less,	and Tommy	likes	variety.	He's	a	fine	chap,	Tommy;	don't	you	think	so?"

Peter	hesitated	a	second,	and	the	other	glanced	at	him	shrewdly.

"Perhaps	you	haven't	been	out	long	enough,"	he	said.

"Perhaps	not,"	said	Peter.	"Not	but	what	I	do	like	him.	He's	a	cheerful	creature for	all	his	grousing,	and	has	sterling	good	stuff	in	him.	But	religiously	I	don't	get on	far.	To	tell	you	the	truth,	I'm	awfully	worried	about	it."

The	elder	man	nodded.	"I	guess	I	know,	lad,"	he	said.	"See	here.	I'm	Presbyterian and	I	reckon	you	are	Anglican,	but	I	expect	we're	up	against	much	the	same	sort of	thing.	Don't	worry	too	much.	Do	your	job	and	talk	straight,	and	the	men'll listen	more	than	you	think."

"But	I	don't	think	I	know	what	to	tell	them,"	said	Peter	miserably,	but	drawn	out by	the	other.

Arnold	smiled.	"The	Prayer	Book's	not	much	use	here,	eh?	But	forgive	me;	I don't	mean	to	be	rude.	I	know	what	you	mean.	To	tell	you	the	truth,	I	think	this war	is	what	we	padres	have	been	needing.	It'll	help	us	to	find	our	feet.	Only—

this	is	honest—if	you	don't	take	care	you	may	lose	them.	I	have	to	keep	a	tight hold	of	that"—and	he	laid	his	hand	on	a	big	Bible—"to	mind	my	own."

Peter	did	not	reply	for	a	minute.	He	could	not	talk	easily	to	a	stranger.	But	at	last he	said:	"Yes;	but	it	doesn't	seem	to	me	to	fit	the	case.	Men	are	different.	Times are	different.	The	New	Testament	people	took	certain	things	for	granted,	and even	if	they	disagreed,	they	always	had	a	common	basis	with	the	Apostles.	Men out	here	seem	to	me	to	talk	a	different	language:	you	don't	know	where	to	begin.

It	seems	to	me	that	they	have	long	ago	ceased	to	believe	in	the	authority	of anyone	or	anything	in	religion,	and	now	to-day	they	actually	deny	our	very commonplaces.	But	I	don't	know	how	to	put	it,"	he	added	lamely.

Arnold	puffed	silently	for	a	little.	Then	he	took	his	pipe	out	of	his	mouth	and regarded	it	critically.	"God's	in	the	soul	of	every	man	still,"	he	said.	"They	can still	hear	Him	speak,	and	speak	there.	And	so	must	we	too,	Graham."

Peter	said	nothing.	In	a	minute	or	so	steps	sounded	in	the	passage,	and	Arnold looked	up	quickly.	"Maybe,"	he	said,	"our	ordinary	life	prevented	us	hearing God	very	plainly	ourselves,	Graham,	and	maybe	He	has	sent	us	here	for	that purpose.	I	hope	so.	I've	wondered	lately	if	we	haven't	come	to	the	kingdom	for such	a	time	as	this."

Pennell	pushed	the	door	open,	and	looked	in.	"You	there,	Graham?"	he	asked.

"Oh,	I	thought	I'd	find	him	here,	padre;	his	stuff's	come."

Peter	got	up.	"Excuse	me,	Arnold,"	he	said;	"I	must	shake	in.	But	I'm	jolly	glad you	said	what	you	did,	and	I	hope	you'll	say	it	again,	and	some	more."

The	older	man	smiled	an	answer,	and	the	door	closed.	Then	he	sighed	a	little, and	stretched	out	his	hand	again	for	the	Bible.





CHAPTER	VI

The	great	central	ward	at	No.	1	Base	Hospital	looked	as	gay	as	possible.	In	the centre	a	Guard's	band	sat	among	palms	and	ferns,	and	an	extemporised	stage, draped	with	flags,	was	behind,	with	wings	constructed	of	Japanese-figured material.	Pretty	well	all	round	were	the	beds,	although	many	of	them	had	been moved	up	into	a	central	position,	and	there	was	a	space	for	chairs	and	forms.	The green-room	had	to	be	outside	the	ward,	and	the	performers,	therefore,	came	and went	in	the	public	gaze.	But	it	was	not	a	critical	public,	and	the	men,	with	a plenitude	of	cigarettes,	did	not	object	to	pauses.	On	the	whole,	they	were extraordinarily	quiet	and	passive.	Modern	science	has	made	the	battlefield	a	hell, but	it	has	also	made	the	base	hospital	something	approaching	a	Paradise.

There	were	women	in	plenty.	The	staff	had	been	augmented	by	visitors	from most	of	the	other	hospitals	in	the	town,	and	there	was	a	fair	sprinkling	of W.A.A.C.'s,	Y.M.C.A.	workers,	and	so	on,	in	addition.	Jack	Donovan	and	Peter were	a	little	late,	and	arrived	at	the	time	an	exceedingly	popular	subaltern	was holding	the	stage	amid	roars	of	laughter.	They	stood	outside	one	of	the	many glass	doors	and	peered	in.

Once	inside,	one	had	to	make	one's	way	among	beds	and	chairs,	and	the	nature of	things	brought	one	into	rather	more	than	the	usual	share	of	late-comers'

scrutiny,	but	nothing	could	abash	Donovan.	He	spotted	at	once	a	handsome woman	in	nurse's	indoor	staff	uniform,	and	made	for	her.	She,	with	two	others, was	sitting	on	an	empty	bed,	and	she	promptly	made	room	for	Donovan.	Graham was	introduced,	and	a	quiet	girl	moved	up	a	bit	for	him	to	sit	down;	but	there was	not	much	room,	and	the	girl	would	not	talk,	so	that	he	sat	uncomfortably and	looked	about	him,	listening	with	one	ear	to	the	fire	of	chaff	on	his	right.

Donovan	was	irrepressible.	His	laugh	and	voice,	and	the	fact	that	he	was	talking to	a	hospital	personage,	attracted	a	certain	amount	of	attention.	Peter	tried	to smile,	but	he	felt	out	of	it	and	observed.	He	stared	up	towards	the	band,	which was	just	striking	up	again.

Suddenly	he	became	conscious,	as	one	will,	that	someone	was	particularly looking	at	him.	He	glanced	back	over	the	chairs,	and	met	a	pair	of	eyes,	roguish, laughing,	and	unquestionably	fixed	upon	him.	The	moment	he	saw	them,	their owner	nodded	and	telegraphed	an	obvious	invitation.	Peter	glanced	at	Donovan: he	had	not	apparently	seen.	He	looked	back;	the	eyes	called	him	again.	He	felt himself	getting	hot,	for,	despite	the	fact	that	he	had	a	kind	of	feeling	that	he	had seen	those	eyes	before,	he	was	perfectly	certain	he	did	not	know	the	girl.	Perhaps she	had	made	a	mistake.	He	turned	resolutely	to	his	companion.

"Jolly	good	band,	isn't	it?"	he	said.

"Yes,"	she	replied.

"But	I	suppose	at	a	hospital	like	this	you're	always	hearing	decent	music?"	he ventured.

"Not	so	often,"	she	said.

"This	band	is	just	back	from	touring	the	front,	isn't	it?	My	friend	said	something to	that	effect."

"I	believe	so,"	she	said.

Peter	could	have	cursed	her.	It	was	impossible	to	get	anything	out	of	her,	though why	he	had	not	a	notion.	The	answer	was	really	simple,	for	she	wanted	to	be next	Donovan,	and	wasn't,	and	she	was	all	the	while	scheming	how	to	get	there.

But	Peter	did	not	tumble	to	that;	he	felt	an	ass	and	very	uncomfortable,	and	he broke	into	open	revolt.

He	looked	steadily	towards	the	chairs.	The	back	of	the	girl	who	had	looked	at him	was	towards	him	now,	for	she	was	talking	sideways	to	somebody;	but	he noted	an	empty	chair	just	next	her,	and	that	her	uniform	was	not	that	of	the nurses	of	this	hospital.	He	felt	confident	that	she	would	look	again,	and	he	was not	disappointed.	Instantly	he	made	up	his	mind,	nodded,	and	reached	for	his cap.	"I	see	a	girl	I	know	over	there,"	he	said	to	his	neighbour.	"Excuse	me,	will you?"	Then	he	got	up	and	walked	boldly	over	to	the	vacant	chair.	He	was	fast acclimatising	to	war	conditions.

He	sat	down	on	that	empty	chair	and	met	the	girl's	eyes	fairly.	She	was	entirely at	her	ease	and	laughing	merrily.	"I've	lost	my	bet,"	she	said,	"and	Tommy's

won."

"And	you've	made	me	tell	a	thundering	lie,"	he	replied,	laughing	too,	"which	you know	is	the	first	step	towards	losing	one's	soul.	Therefore	you	deserve	your share	in	the	loss."

"Why?	What	did	you	say?"	she	demanded.

"I	said	I	saw	a	girl	I	knew,"	he	replied.	"But	I	haven't	any	idea	who	you	are, though	I	can't	help	feeling	I've	seen	you	before."

She	chuckled	with	amusement,	and	turned	to	her	companion.	"He	doesn't remember,	Tommy,"	she	said.

The	second	girl	looked	past	her	to	Peter.	"I	should	think	not,"	she	said.	"Nobody would.	But	he'll	probably	say	in	two	minutes	that	he	does.	You're	perfectly shameless,	Julie."

Julie	swung	round	to	Peter.	"You're	a	beast,	Tommy,"	she	said	over	her	shoulder,

"and	I	shan't	speak	to	you	again.	You	see,"	she	went	on	to	Peter,	"I	could	see	you had	struck	a	footling	girl,	and	as	I	don't	know	a	single	decent	boy	here,	I	thought I'd	presume	on	an	acquaintance,	and	see	if	it	wasn't	a	lucky	one.	We've	got	to know	each	other,	you	know.	The	girl	with	me	on	the	boat—oh,	damn,	I've	told you!—and	I	am	swearing,	and	you're	a	parson,	but	it	can't	be	helped	now—well, the	girl	told	me	we	should	meet	again,	and	that	it	was	probably	you	who	was mixed	up	with	my	fate-line.	What	do	you	think	of	that?"

Peter	had	not	an	idea,	really.	He	was	going	through	the	most	amazing	set	of sensations.	He	felt	heavy	and	dull,	and	as	if	he	were	utterly	at	a	loss	how	to	deal with	a	female	of	so	obviously	and	totally	different	a	kind	from	any	he	had	met before;	but,	with	it	all,	he	was	very	conscious	of	being	glad	to	be	there.

Underneath	everything,	too,	he	felt	a	bit	of	a	dare-devil,	which	was	a	delightful experience	for	a	London	curate;	and	still	deeper,	much	more	mysteriously	and almost	a	little	terrifyingly,	something	stranger	still,	that	he	had	known	this	girl for	ages,	although	he	had	not	seen	her	for	a	long	time.	"I'm	highly	privileged,	I'm sure,"	he	said,	and	could	have	kicked	himself	for	a	stupid	ass.

"Oh	Lord!"	said	Julie,	with	a	mock	expression	of	horror;	"for	goodness'	sake don't	talk	like	that.	That's	the	worst	of	a	parson:	he	can't	forget	the	drawing-room.	At	any	rate,	I'm	not	sure	that	 I'm	highly	fortunate,	but	I	thought	I	ought	to

give	Fate	a	chance.	Do	you	smoke?"

"Yes,"	said	Peter	wonderingly.

"Then	for	goodness'	sake	smoke,	and	you'll	feel	better.	No,	I	daren't	here,	but	I'm glad	you	are	educated	enough	to	ask	me.	Nurses	aren't	supposed	to	smoke	in public,	you	know,	and	I	take	it	that	even	you	have	observed	that	I'm	a	nurse."

She	was	quite	right.	Peter	drew	on	his	cigarette	and	felt	more	at	ease.	"Well,	to be	absolutely	honest,	I	had,"	he	said.	"And	I	observe,	moreover,	that	you	are	not wearing	exactly	an	English	nurse's	uniform,	and	that	you	have	what	I	might venture	to	call	a	zoological	badge.	I	therefore	conclude	that,	like	my	friend Donovan,	you	hail	from	South	Africa.	What	hospital	are	you	in?"

"Quai	de	France,"	she	said.	"Know	it?"

Peter	repressed	a	start.	"Quai	de	France?"	he	queried.	"Where's	that,	now?"

At	this	moment	a	song	started,	but	his	companion	dropped	her	voice	to	stage whisper	and	replied:	"End	of	the	harbour,	near	where	the	leave-boat	starts.	Know it	now?"

He	nodded,	but	was	saved	a	reply.

She	looked	away	toward	the	platform,	and	he	studied	her	face	surreptitiously.	It seemed	very	young	till	you	looked	closely,	especially	at	the	eyes,	and	then	you perceived	something	lurking	there.	She	was	twenty-seven	or	twenty-eight,	he concluded.	She	looked	as	if	she	knew	the	world	inside	out,	and	as	if	there	were something	hidden	below	the	gaiety.	Peter	felt	curiously	and	intensely	attracted.

His	shyness	vanished.	He	had,	and	had	had,	no	intimations	of	the	doings	of Providence,	and	nobody	could	possibly	be	more	sceptical	of	fate-lines	than	he, but	it	dawned	on	him	as	he	stared	at	her	that	he	would	fathom	that	look somehow,	somewhere.

"I'm	practically	not	made	up	at	all,"	she	whispered,	without	turning	her	head,	"so for	Heaven's	sake	don't	say	there's	too	much	powder	on	my	nose."

Peter	shook	silently.	"No,	but	a	faint	trace	on	the	right	cheek,"	he	whispered back.	She	turned	then	and	looked	at	him,	and	her	eyes	challenged	his.	And	yet	it is	to	be	supposed	that	Hilda	knew	nothing	whatever	about	it.

"' Right	on	my	mother's	knee….'"	sang	the	platform.

"' Without	a	shirt,	without	a	shirt,'"	gagged	Peter, sotto	voce,	and	marvelled	at himself.	But	he	felt	that	her	smothered	laughter	amply	rewarded	him.

The	song	ceased	in	time,	and	the	encore,	which	they	both	rigorously	demanded.

And	immediately	she	began	again.

"I	hope	to	goodness	tea	isn't	far	off,"	she	said.	"By	the	way,	you'll	have	to	take me	to	it,	now,	you	know.	We	go	out	of	that	door,	and	up	a	flight	of	steps,	and there's	the	matron's	room	on	the	top	and	a	visitor's	room	next	to	it,	and	tea'll	be there.	It	will	be	a	fiendish	squash,	and	I	wouldn't	go	if	I	hadn't	you	to	get	me	tea and	take	me	away	afterwards	as	soon	as	possible."

"I'm	highly	privileged,	I'm	sure,"	said	Peter	again,	quite	deliberately.	She laughed.	"You	are,"	she	said.	"Look	how	you're	coming	on!	Ten	minutes	ago	you were	a	bored	curate,	and	now	you're—what	are	you?"

Peter	hesitated	perceptibly.	He	felt	he	might	say	many	things.	Then	he	said	"A trapped	padre,"	and	they	both	laughed.

"Thank	goodness	you're	not	sentimental,	anyway,"	she	said.	"Nor's	your	friend; but	the	matron	is.	I	know	her	sort.	Look	at	them."

Peter	looked.	Donovan	appeared	still	entirely	at	his	ease,	but	he	was	watching Peter,	who	realised	why	he	had	been	made	to	look.	He	brazened	it	out,	smiled back	at	him,	and	turned	perfectly	deliberately	to	his	companion.

"Julie,"	he	said,	"don't	look	over	there	any	more,	for	goodness'	sake,	or	we'll have	Donovan	here.	And	if	he	comes	he'll	sail	in	and	take	you	to	tea	without	a word.	I	know	him.	He's	got	an	unfair	advantage	over	me.	I'm	just	waking	up,	and he's	been	awake	for	years.	Please	give	me	a	chance."

She	leaned,	back	and	regarded	him	humorously.	"You're	not	doing	so	badly,"	she said,	"I	don't	know	that	a	man	has	ever	called	me	'Julie'	before	in	the	first	quarter of	an	hour.	Do	you	know	that,	Solomon?"

"It's	your	fault,	I've	never	been	introduced,	and	I	must	call	you	something,	so why	not	the	name	your	friend	called	you?	Julie's	very	pretty	and	suits	you.

Somehow	I	couldn't	call	you	'Miss'	anything,	though	it	may	be	convenient	to

know	the	rest.	Do	you	think	you	could	call	me	the	Rev.	Peter	Graham?"

"I	couldn't,"	she	confessed,	slightly	more	solemnly.	"Queer,	isn't	it?	But	don't, talk	about	it:	it	isn't	lucky.	I	shall	call	you	Solomon	for	ever	now.	And	you	can only	call	me	Miss	Gamelyn	when	you've	got	to.	See?"

"But	why	in	the	world	'Solomon'?	It	doesn't	fit	me	a	bit."

"Oh,"	she	said,	"it	does,	but	don't	worry	why.	Perhaps	because,	as	the	old	man said	to	the	vicar	when	he	heard	of	Solomon's	wives,	you	are	a	highly	privileged Christian.	You	can't	deny	that,	since	you've	said	it	twice.	Praises	be,	here	is	tea.

Come	on;	come	on,	Tommy.	Oh,	Tommy,	this	is	the	Very	Reverend	Peter Graham.	Mr.	Graham,	this	is	one	Raynard,	commonly	known	as	Tommy,	my half-section,	so	try	to	be	polite."

There	was	a	general	movement,	and	Peter	shook	hands	as	he	got	up.	The	other girl	struck	him	at	once	as	a	good	sort.

"You're	booked	to	take	us	to	tea,	I	suppose?"	she	said.	"Julie's	far	more	practical than	you'd	imagine,	padre."

They	left	the	row	of	chairs	together,	Julie	well	in	front	and	apparently	forgetful of	their	existence.	As	they	came	abreast	of	the	empty	bed,	Peter	noticed	that	the assistant	matron	had	gone,	and	that	Donovan	was	drifting	in	the	stream alongside	her	in	front.	But	before	they	were	out	of	the	great	ward,	Julie	and	he were	laughing	together.	Peter	felt	absurdly	hurt,	and	hated	himself	for	feeling	it.

The	other	girl	was	talking	at	his	elbow,	but	he	made	ridiculous	and commonplace	replies	and	hardly	noticed	her.	She	broke	off	at	last	abruptly,	and he	roused	himself	to	carry	on.	He	caught	her	expression,	and	somehow	or	other it	landed	him	deeper	in	the	business.	He	made	a	deliberate	move.

"Where	are	you	going	after	this?"	he	asked.

"Down	town	to	do	some	shopping;	then	I	suppose	home,	unless	a	fit	seizes Julie	and	we	run	a	risk	once	more	of	being	summarily	repatriated."

He	laughed.	"Does	that	often	happen?"

"Quite	often.	You	see	ours	is	an	English	hospital,	though	we	are	South	Africans attached	to	it.	I	think	they're	much	more	strict	than	Colonial	hospitals.	But	they

give	us	more	latitude	than	the	rest,	at	any	rate.	Julie	had	a	fearful	row	once,	and simply	declared	she	would	do	some	things,	and	since	then	they	turn	a	blind	eye occasionally.	But	there	are	limits,	and	one	day	she'll	step	over	them—I	know	she will."

"Let's	hope	not,"	said	Peter;	"but	now	let	me	get	you	some	tea."

The	little	room	was	packed,	but	Peter	got	through	somehow	and	made	his	way	to a	series	of	tables	spread	with	cakes	and	sandwiches.	He	got	a	cup	and	seized	a plate,	and	shouldered	his	way	back.	In	the	crush	he	saw	only	the	top	of	Miss Raynard's	head,	and	made	for	that.	"Here	you	are,"	he	said	cheerfully,	as	he emerged.	"Have	a	sandwich?"

"Thanks,"	she	said	as	she	took	it;	"but	why	didn't	you	bring	two	cups?"

"Why?"	he	asked.

She	nodded	towards	a	corner	and	there	was	Julie,	wedged	in	between	people, and	refusing	tea	from	a	subaltern.	"She	expects	you	to	bring	it,"	said	Miss Raynard.

Peter	looked	puzzled,	"Where's	Donovan?"	he	said.	"I	thought	she	came	in	with him."

The	girl	smiled.	"She	did,	but	she	arranged	for	you	to	bring	her	tea,	whoever Donovan	is,	and	she'll	wait	for	it.	She's	that	sort.	Besides,	if	Donovan	was	that officer	with	the	matron,	he's	probably	got	other	fish	to	fry."

Peter	waited	for	no	more,	but	plunged	into	the	press	again.	As	he	emerged,	he crossed	the	track	of	his	friend,	who	was	steering	about	with	cakes.	"Hullo, padre,"	that	individual	said;	"you're	a	smart	one,	you	are.	Let's	take	those	girls out	to	dinner.	They'll	come	all	right."

Peter	mumbled	something,	and	went	on	with	his	tea	towards	the	corner.	The other's	readiness	and	effrontery	staggered	him,	but	he	wasn't	going	to	give himself	away.

"You're	a	brute!"	said	Julie	promptly.	"Where	have	you	been?"

"It's	where	have	you	been,	you	mean,"	retorted	Peter.	"I	thought	I	was	to	take

you	in	to	tea.	When	last	I	saw	you,	you	had	Donovan	in	tow."

"And	you	had	Tommy.	Don't	you	like	her?"

"Awfully,"	said	Peter;	"I	think	she	wants	something	now.	But	do	come	across	to our	side.	Aren't	you	going	soon?"

"Yes,	when	we	can	get	away.	Remember,	everyone	is	watching.	You	go	on	out, and	we	can	meet	you	below."

"Right,"	said	Peter;	"I'll	collect	Donovan."

He	found	him	after	a	bit,	and	the	two	made	their	adieus	and	thanks.

As	they	went	down	the	steps,	Jack	outlined	the	campaign.	"I	just	joked	to	her about	dinner,"	he	said,	"but	I	think	they'll	rise.	If	they	do,	we'll	go	to	Travalini's, if	they	dare.	That	girl	of	yours	is	up	to	anything:	she	knows	a	thing	or	two.

You've	some	nerve,	old	thing."

"Nothing	to	yours,"	retorted	Graham,	still	not	at	all	sure	of	himself.	"But,	look here,	what	about	Travalini's?	I	don't	know	that	I	care	to	go	there."

"Oh,	it's	all	right,	old	dear.	You	haven't	a	vast	collar	on	now,	and	you ought	to	see	life.	I've	seen	scores	of	chaplains	there,	even	old	Arnold.

I'll	look	after	your	morals.	Come	on;	let's	get	out	and	across	the	road.

We	shall	see	them	coming	down	the	steps."

The	hospital	fronted	on	to	the	sea	and	the	promenade	that	once	was	so fashionable.	The	sun	was	setting,	blood	red,	over	the	Channel,	the	ships	at anchor	looking	dark	by	contrast.	But	there	was	still	plenty	of	light,	and	Peter	was inwardly	conscious	of	his	badges.	Still,	he	told	himself	that	he	was	an	ass,	and the	two	of	them	sauntered	slowly	townwards.

In	a	few	minutes	Jack	glanced	back.	"They're	coming,"	he	said,	and	as	the	girls crossed	on	to	the	pavement	behind	them,	turned	round.	"Good	for	you,"	he	said.

"You	got	out	quicker	than	I	thought	you	would.	Shall	we	tram	or	walk?"

"Walk,	I	think,"	said	Julie;	"it's	topping	here	by	the	sea.	I	want	to	get	a	pair	of shoes,	and	the	shop's	not	too	far.	Besides,	you	can	buy	shoes	by	artificial	light, which	won't	do	for	some	things.	Tommy	bought	a	hat	the	other	night,	and	she

nearly	had	a	fit	in	the	morning.	She's	keeping	it	for	the	next	fancy-dress	stunt."

She	ran	on,	and,	despite	Peter,	Donovan	annexed	her.	They	set	off	gaily	ahead, Julie's	clear	laugh	coming	back	now	and	again.	Peter	felt	depressed	and	angry.

He	told	himself	he	was	being	let	in	for	something	he	did	not	want,	and	he	had not	much	to	say.	To	make	conversation,	he	asked	about	South	Africa.

It	appeared	the	girls	came	from	Natal.	Miss	Raynard	was	enthusiastic,	and	he gathered	they	had	been	trained	together	in	Pietermaritzburg,	but	lived somewhere	on	the	coast,	where	there	was	tennis	all	the	year	and	moonlight bathing	picnics	in	the	season,	and	excellent	river	boating.	He	could	not	catch	the name,	but	it	was	not	too	far	from	Durban.	He	said,	in	the	end,	that	he	had	always wanted	to	visit	South	Africa,	and	should	certainly	come	to	Natal….

They	turned	off	the	promenade	into	a	boulevard	lined	with	the	usual	avenue	of trees.	It	was	dusk	now,	and	looked	darker	by	contrast	with	the	street	lamps.

Small	tram-cars	rushed	by	now	and	again,	with	clanging	bells	and	platforms crowded	before	and	behind,	and	there	were	plenty	of	people	in	the	street,	Julie turned	abruptly.

"I	say,	Tommy,"	she	said,	"Captain	Donovan	wants	us	to	go	out	to	dinner.	What do	you	say?	My	shoes	can	wait,	and	we	needn't	be	in	till	eight-thirty.	It's	not more	than	six	now.	It	will	be	a	spree."

"I'm	game;	but	where	are	we	going?"

"I	suggest	Travalini's,	padre,"	said	Donovan.

"Not	for	me;"	said	Miss	Raynard;	"it's	too	public	and	you	seem	to	forget, Captain'	Donovan,	that	we	are	forbidden	to	dine	with	officers."

"Nobody	is	likely	to	give	us	away,	Tommy,"	said	Miss	Gamelyn.

"I'm	not	going	to	take	the	risk	in	uniform.	Let's	go	to	a	quiet	hotel,	or	else	to some	very	French	place.	That	would	be	fun."

"A	jolly	good	idea,"	cried	Donovan,	"and	I	know	what	will	just	fix	us	up.

Come	on."

Tommy	smiled.	"Probably	it	 will	fix	us	up.	Tell	us	about	it	first."

"It's	absolutely	safe,"	Donovan	protested.	"It's	quite	French,	and	we	shall	get	one knife	and	fork	each.	There's	a	cinema	on	top,	and	billiards	underneath,	and practically	no	officers	go.	A	Belgian	Captain	I	came	out	with	took	me.	He	said you	could	'eat	well'	there,	and	you	can,	for	the	cooking	is	a	treat.	I	swear	it's	all right."

"Lead	on,"	said	Julie;	"we'll	trust	you,"	and	she	manoeuvred	so	that	her	half-section	was	left	with	Donovan.

The	four	walked	briskly	through	the	dusk.	"Don't	you	love	France	in	the evening?"	demanded	Julie.

"Yes,"	said	Peter,	but	dubiously.	"I	don't	know	it	much	yet,"	he	added.

"Oh,	I	do.	Even	a	girl	can	almost	do	what	she	likes	out	here.	I've	had	some	awful fun	in	Havre.	I	think	one	ought	to	take	one's	pleasure	when	one	has	the	chance, don't	you?	But	some	of	these	girls	give	me	the	hump;	they're	so	narrow.	They can't	see	you	with	a	man	without	imagining	all	sorts	of	things,	whereas	I've	had some	rattling	good	pals	among	men	out	here.	Then	they're	so	afraid	of	doing things—the	girls,	I	mean.	Do	you	know	I	went	to	Paris	when	I	came	up	here from	Boulogne?	Had	absolutely	 the	time.	Of	course,	nobody	knows,	so	don't speak	of	it—except	Tommy,	of	course."

"How	did	you	do	it?"	demanded	Peter,	amused.

"Well,	you	see,	I	and	another	girl,	English,	were	sent	over	by	Boulogne,	as	you know,	because	you	saw	us	on	the	boat,	and	we	were	supposed	to	come	straight here.	In	the	train	we	met	a	Canadian	in	the	French	Air	Service,	and	he	put	us wise	about	changing,	and	so	on.	But	it	appeared	you	have	to	change	at	Amiens in	the	middle	of	the	night,	and	he	said	the	thing	was	to	sleep	in	the	train	and	go right	on	to	Paris.	Then	you	got	twenty-four	hours	there,	and	left	next	day	by	the Havre	express.	The	girl	was	horribly	scared,	but	I	said	we'd	try	it.	Nothing happened	at	all.	We	had	a	carriage	to	ourselves,	and	merely	sat	still	at	Amiens.

When	we	got	to	Paris	we	simply	walked	out,	bold	as	brass.	I	showed	our	tickets at	Havre	and	told	the	French	inspector	we	had	overslept.	He	merely	told	us	the time	to	leave	next	day.	We	went	to	an	hotel,	and	then	strolled	up	the	Avenue	de l'Opera.	And	what	do	you	think?	Who	should	I	see	but	an	old	dear	of	a	General	I knew	out	in	South	Africa	who	is	in	the	French	Red	Cross.	He	was	simply delighted	to	see	us.	He	motored	us	out	to	the	Bois	in	the	afternoon,	dined	us,	and

took	us	to	the	theatre—only,	by	Jove!	I	did	curse	that	other	girl.	She	was	in	a ferment	all	the	time.	Next	morning	he	had	a	job	on,	but	he	sent	a	car	for	us	with a	subaltern	to	put	us	on	the	train,	and	we	went	to	the	R.T.O.	this	time.	He couldn't	do	enough	for	us	when	he	heard	the	name	of	General	de	Villiers	and saw	his	card.	We	got	into	Havre	at	midday,	and	nobody	was	a	penny	the	wiser."

Peter	laughed.	"You	were	lucky,"	he	said;	"perhaps	you	always	are."

"No,	I'm	not,"	she	said	"but	I	usually	do	what	I	want	and	get	through	with	it.

Hullo,	is	this	the	place?"

"I	suppose	so,"	said	Peter.	"Now	for	it.	Look	as	if	you'd	been	going	to	such places	all	your	life."

"I've	probably	been	more	often	than	you,	anyhow,	Solomon,"	said	Julie,	and	she ran	lightly	up	the	steps.

They	passed	through	swing-doors	into	a	larger	hall	brilliantly	lit	and	heavy	with a	mixed	aroma	of	smoke	and	food.	There	was	a	sort	of	hum	of	sound	going	on all	the	time	and	Peter	looked	round	wonderingly.	He	perceived	immediately	that there	was	an	atmosphere	about	this	French	restaurant	unlike	that	of	any	he	had been	in	before.	He	was,	in	truth,	utterly	bewildered	by	what	he	saw,	but	he	made an	effort	not	to	show	it.	Julie,	on	the	other	hand,	was	fairly	carried	away.	They seated	themselves	at	a	table	for	four	near	the	end	of	the	partition,	and	she	led	the party	in	gaiety.	Donovan	hardly	took	his	eyes	off	her,	and	cut	in	with	dry,	daring remarks	with	a	natural	case.	Tommy	played	a	good	second	to	Julie,	and	if	she had	had	any	fears	they	were	not	visible	now.

"What	about	an	appetiser?"	demanded	Donovan.

"Oh,	rather!	Mixed	vermuth	for	me;	but	Tommy	must	have	a	very	small	one:	she gets	drunk	on	nothing.	Give	me	a	cigarette	now,	padre;	I'm	dying	to	smoke."

Peter	produced	his	case.	"Don't	call	him	'padre'	here,"	said	Donovan;	"you'll spoil	his	enjoyment."

"A	cigarette,	Solomon,	then,"	whispered	Julie,	as	the	other	turned	to	beckon	a garçon,	flashing	her	eyes	on	him.

Peter	resisted	no	longer.	"Don't,"	he	said.	"Call	me	anything	but	that."	It	seemed

to	him	that	there	was	something	inevitable	in	it	all.	He	did	not	formulate	his sensations,	but	it	was	the	lure	of	the	contrast	that	won	him.	Ever	since	he	had landed	in	France	he	had,	as	it	were,	hung	on	to	the	old	conventional	position,	and he	had	felt	increasingly	that	it	was	impossible	to	do	so.	True,	there	seemed	little connection	between	a	dinner	with	a	couple	of	madcap	girls	in	a	French restaurant	and	religion,	but	there	was	one.	He	had	felt	out	of	touch	with	men	and life,	and	now	a	new	phase	of	it	was	offered	him.	He	reached	out	for	it	eagerly.

Julie	leaned	back	and	blew	out	a	thin	stream	of	smoke,	her	eyes	daring	him, picking	up	the	little	glass	as	she	did	so.

"Here's	to	the	girl	with	the	little	grey	shoes," 	she	chanted	merrily.

"Don't	Julie,	for	Heaven's	sake!"	pleaded	Tommy.	"He'll	be	shocked."

"Oh,	go	on,"	said	Peter;	"what	is	it?"

"Captain	Donovan	will	finish,"	laughed	Julie.

"'Deed	I	can't,	for	I	don't	know	it,"	he	said.	"Let's	have	it,	little	girl;	I'm	sure	it's	a sporting	toast."

" Who	eats	your	grub	and	drinks	your	booze,"	continued	she.

"Shut	up,	Julie,"	said	Tommy,	leaning	over	as	if	to	snatch	her	glass.

" And	then	goes	home	to	her	mother	to	snooze,"	called	Julie	breathlessly,	leaning back.

" I	don't	think,"	ejaculated	Donovan.

Julie	tipped	down	the	drink.	"You	knew	it	all	the	time,"	she	said.	And	they	all burst	out	laughing.

Peter	drank,	and	called	for	another,	his	eyes	on	Julie.	He	knew	that	he	could	not sum	her	up,	but	he	refused	to	believe	that	this	was	the	secret	behind	the	eyes.

She	was	too	gay,	too	insolent.	What	Donovan	thought	he	could	not	say,	but	he almost	hated	him	for	the	ease	with	which	he	kept	pace	with	their	companions.

They	ordered	dinner,	and	the	great	dish	of	 hors	d'oeuvres	was	brought	round	by

a	waiter	who	seemed	to	preside	over	it	with	a	fatherly	solicitude.	Julie	picked	up an	olive	in	her	fingers,	and	found	it	so	good	that	she	grumbled	at	only	having taken	one.

"Have	mine,"	said	Donovan,	shooting	one	on	to	her	plate.

"Thanks,"	she	said.	"Oh,	heavens!	I	forgot	that	patch	on	my	left	cheek—or	was	it my	right,	Solomon?	Let's	see."

She	dived	into	her	pocket,	and	produced	a	tiny	satin	beaded	box,	"Isn't	it	chic?"

she	demanded,	leaning	over	to	show	Donovan.	"I	got	it	in	the	Nouvelles	Galeries the	other	day."	She	took	off	the	lid,	which	revealed	its	reverse	as	a	tiny	mirror, and	scrutinised	herself,	patting	back	a	stray	lock	on	her	forehead.

"Oh,	don't,"	said	Donovan,	and	he	slipped	the	hair	out	again	with	his	finger.

"Be	quiet;	but	I'll	concede	that.	This	won't	do,	though."	Out	came	a	tiny	powder-puff.	"How's	that?"	she	demanded,	smiling	up	at	him.

"Perfect,"	he	said.	"But	it's	not	fair	to	do	that	here."

"Wait	for	the	taxi	then,"	she	said.	"Besides,	it	won't	matter	so	much	then."

"What	won't	matter?"	demanded	Peter.

"Solomon,	dear,	you're	as	innocent	as	a	new-born	babe.	Isn't	he?"	she	demanded of	his	friend.

Donovan	looked	across	at	him.	"Still	waters	run	deep,"	he	said.	"I	don't	know, but	excuse	me!"

He	had	been	sitting	next	Julie	and	opposite	Miss	Raynard,	but	he	was	now	on	his feet	and	begging	her	to	change	places	with	him.	She	consented,	laughing,	and did	so,	but	Julie	pretended	to	be	furious.

"I	won't	have	it.	You're	a	perfect	beast,	Tommy.	Captain	Donovan,	I'll	never come	out	with	you	again.	Solomon,	come	and	sit	here,	and	you,	Tommy,	go	over there."

Peter	hadn't	an	idea	why,	but	he	too	got	up.	Tommy	protested.	"Look	here,"	she

said,	"I	came	for	dinner,	not	for	a	dance.	Oh,	look	out,	Captain	Graham;	you'll upset	the	cutlets!"	Peter	avoided	the	waiter	by	an	effort,	but	came	on	round	her to	the	other	side.

"Get	out	of	it,	Tommy,"	said	Julie,	leaning	over	and	pushing	her.	"I	will	have	a man	beside	me,	anyhow."

"I'd	sooner	be	opposite,"	said	Donovan.	"I	can	see	you	better,	and	you	can't	make eyes	at	the	Frenchman	at	the	other	table	quite	so	well	if	I	get	my	head	in	the way."

"Oh,	but	he's	such	a	dear,"	said	Julie.	"I'd	love	to	flirt	with	him.	Only I	must	say	his	hair	is	a	bit	greasy."

"You'll	make	his	lady	furious	if	you	don't	take	care,"	said	Donovan,	"and	it's	a shame	to	spoil	her	trade."

Peter	glanced	across.	A	French	officer,	sitting	opposite	a	painted	girl,	was smiling	at	them.	He	looked	at	Julie;	she	was	smiling	back.

"Julie,	don't	for	Heaven's	sake,"	said	her	half-section.	"We	shall	have	him	over here	next,	and	you	remember	once	before	how	awkward	it	was."

Julie	laughed.	"Give	me	another	drink,	then,	Captain	Donovan,"	she	said,	"and I'll	be	good."

Donovan	filled	up	her	glass.	She	raised	it	and	challenged	him.	" Here's	to	we	two in	Blighty,"	she	began.

Miss	Raynard	rose	determinedly	and	interrupted	her.	"Come	on,"	she	said;	"that's a	bit	too	much,	Julie.	We	must	go,	or	we'll	never	get	back,	and	don't	forget you've	got	to	go	on	duty	in	the	morning,	my	dear."	She	pulled	out	a	little	watch.

"Good	heavens!"	she	cried.	"Do	you	know	the	time?	It's	eight-twenty	now.	We ought	to	have	been	in	by	eight,	and	eighty-thirty	is	the	latest	time	that's	safe.	For any	sake,	come	on."

Julie	for	once	agreed.	"Good	Lord,	yes,"	she	said.	"We	must	have	a	taxi.

Can	we	get	one	easily?"

"Oh,	I	expect	so,"	said	Donovan.	"Settle	up,	Graham,	will	you?	while	I	shepherd

them	out	and	get	a	car.	Come	on,	and	take	care	how	you	pass	the	Frenchman."

In	a	few	minutes	Peter	joined	them	on	the	steps	outside.	The	restaurant	was	in the	corner	of	a	square	which	contained	a	small	public	garden,	and	the	three	of them	were	waiting	for	him	on	the	curb.	A	taxi	stood	by	them.	The	broad	streets ran	away	to	left	and	right,	gay	with	lights	and	passers-by,	and	the	dark	trees stood	out	against	a	starry	sky.	A	group	of	British	officers	went	laughing	by,	and one	of	them	recognised	Donovan	and	hailed	him.	Two	spahis	crossed	out	of	the shade	into	the	light,	their	red	and	gold	a	picturesque	splash	of	colour.	Behind them	glared	the	staring	pictures	of	the	cinema	show	on	a	great	hoarding	by	the wall.

"Come	on,	Graham,"	called	Donovan,	"hop	in."

The	four	packed	in	closely,	Peter	and	Tommy	opposite	the	other	two,	Julie farthest	from	Peter.	They	started,	and	he	caught	her	profile	as	the	street	lights shone	in	and	out	with	the	speed	of	their	passing.	She	was	smoking,	puffing quickly	at	her	cigarette,	and	hardly	silent	a	moment.

"It's	been	a	perfect	treat,"	she	said.	"You're	both	dears,	aren't	they,	Tommy?	You must	come	and	have	tea	at	the	hospital	any	day:	just	walk	in.	Mine's	Ward	3.

Come	about	four	o'clock,	and	you'll	find	me	any	day	this	week,	Tommy's opposite.	There's	usually	a	crush	at	tea,	but	you	must	come.	By	the	way,	where's your	camp?	Aren't	you	going	heaps	out	of	your	way?	Solomon,	where	do	you live?	Tell	me."

Peter	grinned	in	the	dark,	and	told	her.

"Oh,	you	perfect	beast!"	she	said,	"Then	you	knew	the	Quai	de	France	all	the time.	Well,	you're	jolly	near,	anyway."	"Oh,	Lord!"	she	exclaimed	suddenly,

"you	aren't	the	new	padre?"

"I	am,"	said	Peter.

"Good	Lord!	what	a	spree!	Then	you'll	come	in	on	duty.	You	can	come	in	any hour	of	the	day	or	night.	Tommy,	do	you	hear	that?	Solomon's	our	spiritual pastor.	He's	begun	well,	hasn't	he?"

Peter	was	silent.	It	jarred	him	horribly.	But	just	then	the	car	slowed	down.

"What's	up	now?"	demanded	Donovan.

"Only	the	sentry	at	the	swing	bridge,"	said	Tommy.	"They	stop	all	cars	at	night.

He's	your	side,	dear;	give	him	the	glad	eye."

The	door	opened,	and	a	red-cap	looked	in.	"Hospital,	corporal;	it's	all	right,"	said Julie,	beaming	at	him.

"Oh,	all	right,	miss.	Good-night,"	said	the	man,	stepping	back	and	saluting	in	the light	of	the	big	electric	standard	at	the	bridgehead.	"Carry	on,	driver!"

"We're	just	there,"	said	Julie;	"I	am	sorry.	It's	been	rippin'.	Stop	the	car,	Solomon, somewhere	near	the	leave-boat;	it	won't	do	to	drive	right	up	to	the	hospital;	we might	be	spotted."

Peter	leaned	out	of	the	window	on	his	side.	The	lights	on	the	quay	glowed steadily	across	the	dark	water,	and	made	golden	flicking	streaks	upon	it	as	the tide	swelled	slowly	in.	In	the	distance	a	great	red	eye	flashed	in	and	out solemnly,	and	on	their	side	he	could	see	the	shaded	lights	of	the	hospital	ship, getting	ready	for	her	night	crossing.	He	judged	it	was	time,	and	told	the	man	to stop.

"Where's	my	powder-puff?"	demanded	Julie.	"I	believe	you've	bagged	it, Captain	Donovan.	No,	it's	here.	Skip	out,	Tommy.	Is	anyone	about?"

"No,"	said	the	girl	from	the	step.	"But	don't	wait	all	night.	We'd	best	run	for	it."

"Well,	good-night,"	said	Julie.	"You	have	both	been	dears,	but	whether I'm	steady	enough	to	get	in	safely	I	don't	know.	Still,	Tommy's	a	rock.

See	you	again	soon.	Good-bye-ee!"

She	leaned	forward.	" Now,	if	you're	good,"	she	said	to	Donovan.	He	kissed	her, laughing;	and	before	he	knew	what	she	was	doing,	she	reached	over	to	Peter, kissed	him	twice	on	the	lips,	and	leaped	lightly	out.	"Be	good,"	she	said,	"and	if you	can't,	be	careful."





CHAPTER	VII

Following	a	delay	of	some	days,	there	had	been	a	fairly	heavy	mail,	and	Peter took	his	letters	to	the	little	terrace	by	the	sea	outside	the	mess,	and	sat	in	the	sun to	read	them.	While	he	was	so	occupied	Arnold	appeared	with	a	pipe,	but,	seeing him	engaged,	went	back	for	a	novel	and	a	deck-chair.	It	was	all	very	peaceful and	still,	and	beyond	occasional	hammering	from,	the	leisurely	construction	of the	outer	harbour	wall	and	once	or	twice	the	siren	of	a	signalling	steamer entering	the	docks,	there	was	nothing	to	disturb	them	at	all.	Perhaps	half	an	hour passed,	then	Peter	folded	up	some	sheets,	put	them	in	his	pocket,	and	walked moodily	to	the	edge	of	the	concrete,	staring	down,	at	the	lazy	slushing	of	the	tide against:	the	wall	below	him.

He	kicked	a	pebble	discontentedly	into	the	water,	and	turned	to	look,	at	Arnold.

The	older	man	was	stretched	out:	in	his	chair	smoking	a	pipe	and	regarding	him.

A	slow	smile	passed	between	them.

"No,	hang	it	all,"	said	Peter;	"there's	nothing	to	smile	about,	Arnold, I've	pretty	well	got	to	the	end	of	my	tether."

"Meaning	what	exactly?"	queried	the	other.

"Oh,	well,	you	know	enough	already	to	guess	the	rest….	Look	here,	Arnold,	you and.	I	are	fairly	good	pals	now,	I'd	just	like	to	tell	you	exactly	what	I	feel."

"Sit	down	then,	man,	and	get	it	out.	There's	a	chair	yonder,	and	you've	got	the forenoon	before	ye.	I'm	a	heretic	and	all	that	sort	of	thing,	of	course,	but	perhaps that'll	make	it	easier.	I	take	it	it's	a	kind	of	heretic	you're	becoming	yourself."

Peter	pulled	up	a	chair	and	got	out	his	own	pipe.	"Arnold,"	he	said,	"I'm	too serious	to	joke,	and	I	don't	know	that	I'm	even	a	Christian	heretic.	I	don't	know what	I	am	and	where	I	stand.	I	wish	I	did;	I	wish	I	even	knew	how	much	I

disbelieved,	for	then	I'd	know	what	to	do.	But	it's	not	that	my	dogmas	have	been attacked	and	weakened.	I've	no	new	light	on	the	Apostles'	Creed	and	no	fresh doubts	about	it.	I	could	still	argue	for	the	Virgin	Birth	of	Christ	and	the	Trinity, and	so	on.	But	it's	worse	than	that.	I	feel	…"	He	broke	off	abruptly	and	pulled	at his	pipe.	The	other	said	nothing.	They	were	friends	enough	by	now	to understand	each	other.	In	a	little	while	the	younger	man	found	the	words	he wanted.

"Look	here,	it's	like	this.	I	remember	once,	on	the	East	Coast,	coming	across	a stone	breakwater	high	and	dry	in	a	field	half	a	mile	from	the	sea.	There	was nothing	the	matter	with	the	breakwater,	and	it	served	admirably	for	certain purposes—a	seat,	for	instance,	or	a	shady	place	for	a	picnic.	But	it	was	no	longer of	any	vital	use	in	the	world,	for	the	sea	had	receded	and	left	it	there.	Now,	that's just	what	I	feel.	I	had	a	religion;	I	suppose	it	had	its	weaknesses	and	its	faults; but	most	of	it	was	good	sound	stone,	and	it	certainly	had	served.	But	it	serves	no longer,	not	because	it's	damaged,	but	because	the	need	for	it	has	changed	its nature	or	is	no	longer	there."	He	trailed	off	into	silence	and	stopped.

Arnold	stirred	to	get	out	his	pouch.	"The	sea	is	shifty,	though,"	he	said.	"If	they keep	the	breakwater	in	decent	repair,	it'll	come	in	handy	again."

"Yes,"	burst	out	Peter.	"But,	of	course,	that's	where	illustrations	are	so	little good:	you	can't	press	them.	And	in	any	case	no	engineer	worth	his	salt	would	sit down	by	his	breakwater	and	smoke	a	pipe	till	the	sea	came	in	handy	again.	His job	is	to	go	after	it."

"True	for	ye,	boy.	But	if	the	old	plan	was	so	good,	why	not	go	down	to	the	beach and	get	on	with	building	operations	of	the	same	sort?"

"Arnold,"	said	Peter,	"you	couldn't	have	put	it	better.	That's	exactly	what	I	came here	to	do.	I	knew	in	London	that	the	sea	was	receding	to	some	extent,	and	I thought	that	there	was	a	jolly	good	chance	to	get	up	with	it	again	out	here.	But that	leads	straight	to	my	second	problem:	I	can't	build	on	the	old	plan,	and	it doesn't	seem	any	good.	It's	as	if	our	engineer	found	quicksands	that	wouldn't hold	his	stone,	and	cross-currents	that	smashed	up	all	his	piles….	I	mean,	I thought	I	knew	what	would	save	souls.	But	I	find	that	I	can't	because	my methods	are—I	don't	know,	faulty	perhaps,	out	of	date	maybe	possibly	worse; and,	what	is	more,	the	souls	don't	want	my	saving.	The	Lord	knows	they	want something;	I	can	see	that	fast	enough,	but	what	it	is	I	don't	know.	Heavens!	I

remember	preaching	in	the	beginning	of	the	war	from	the	text	'Jesus	had compassion	on	the	multitude.'	Well	I	don't	feel	that	He	has	changed,	and	I'm quite	sure	He	still	has	compassion,	but	the	multitude	doesn't	want	it.	I	was	wrong about	the	crowd.	It's	nothing	like	what	I	imagined.	The	crowd	isn't	interested	in Jesus	any	more.	It	doesn't	believe	in	Him.	It's	a	different	sort	of	crowd	altogether from	the	one	He	led."

"I	wonder,"	said	Arnold.

Peter	moved	impatiently.	"Well,	I	don't	see	how	you	can,"	he	said.	"Do	you	think Tommy	worries	about	his	sins?	Are	the	men	in	our	mess	miserable?	Does	the girl	the	good	books	talked	about,	who	flirts	and	smokes	and	drinks	and	laughs, sit	down	by	night	on	the	edge	of	her	little	white	bed	and	feel	a	blank	in	her	life?

Does	she,	Arnold?"

"I'm	blest	if	I	know;	I	haven't	been	there!	You	seem	to	know	a	precious	lot	about it,"	he	added	dryly.

"Oh,	don't	rag	and	don't	be	facetious.	If	you	do,	I	shall	clear.	I'm	trying	to	talk sense,	and	at	any	rate	it's	what	I	feel.	And	I	believe	you	know	I'm	right	too."

Peter	was	plainly	a	bit	annoyed.

The	elder	padre	sat	up	straight	at	that,	and	his	tone	changed.	He	stared thoughtfully	out	to	sea	and	did	not	smoke.	But	he	did	not	speak	all	at	once.	Peter glanced	at	him,	and	then	lay	back	in	his	chair	and	waited.

Arnold	spoke	at	last:	possibly	the	harbour	works	inspired	him.	"Look	here,	boy,"

he	said,	"let's	get	back	to	your	illustration,	which	is	no	such	a	bad	one.	What	do you	suppose	your	engineer	would	do	when	he	got	down	to	the	new	sea-beach and	found	the	conditions	you	described?	It	wouldn't	do	much	good	if	he	sat down	and	cursed	the	blessed	sea	and	the	sands	and	the	currents,	would	it?	It would	be	mighty	little	use	if	he	blamed	his	good	stone	and	sound	timber,	useless though	they	appeared.	I'm	thinking	he'd	be	no	much	of	an	engineer	either	if	he chucked	his	job.	What	would	he	do,	d'you	think?"

"Go	on,"	said	Peter,	interested.

"Well,"	said	the	speaker	in	parables,	"unless	I'm	mighty	mistaken,	he'd	get	down first	to	studying	the	new	conditions.	He'd	find	they'd	got	laws	governing	them, same	as	the	old—different	laws	maybe,	but	things	you	could	perhaps	reckon

with	if	you	knew	them.	And	when	he	knew	them,	I	reckon	he'd	have	a	look	at	his timber	and	stone	and	iron,	and	get	out	plans.	Maybe,	these	days,	he'd	help	out with	a	few	tons	of	reinforced	concrete,	and	get	in	a	bit	o'	work	with	some	high explosive.	I'm	no	saying.	But	if	he	came	from	north	of	the	Tweed,	my	lad,"	he added,	with	a	twinkle	in	his	eye	and	a	touch	of	accent,	"I	should	be	verra surprised	if	that	foreshore	hadn't	a	breakwater	that	would	do	its	duty	in	none	so long	a	while."

"And	if	he	came	from	south	of	the	Tweed,	and	found	himself	in	France?"	queried Peter.

"I	reckon	he'd	get	down	among	the	multitude	and	make	a	few	inquiries,"	said Arnold,	more	gravely.	"I	reckon	he	wouldn't	be	in	too	great	a	hurry,	and	he wouldn't	believe	all	he	saw	and	heard	without	chewing	on	it	a	bit,	as	our	Yankee friends	say.	And	he'd	know	well	enough	that	there	was	nothing	wrong	with	his Master,	and	no	change	in	His	compassion,	only,	maybe,	that	he	had	perhaps misunderstood	both	a	little."

A	big	steamer	hooted	as	she	came	up	the	river,	and	the	echoes	of	the	siren	died out	slowly	among	the	houses	that	climbed	up	the	hill	behind	them.

Then	Peter	put	his	hand	up	and	rested	his	head	upon	it,	shading	his	face.

"That's	difficult—and	dangerous,	Arnold"	he	said.

"It	is	that,	laddie,"	the	other	answered	quickly.	"There	was	a	time	when	I	would have	thought	it	too	difficult	and	too	dangerous	for	a	boy	of	mine.	But	I've	had	a lesson	or	two	to	learn	out	here	as	well	as	other	folks.	Up	the	line	men	have	learnt not	to	hesitate	at	things	because	they	are	difficult	and	dangerous.	And	I'll	tell	you something	else	we've	learnt—that	it	is	better	for	half	a	million	to	fail	in	the trying	than	for	the	thing	not	to	be	tried	at	all."

"Arnold,"	said	Peter,	"what	about	yourself?	Do	you	mind	my	asking?	Do	you feel	this	sort	of	thing	at	all,	and,	if	so,	what's	your	solution?"

The	padre	from	north	of	the	Tweed	knocked	the	ashes	out	of	his	pipe	and	got	up,

"Young	man,"	he	said,	"I	don't	mind	your	asking,	but	I'm	getting	old,	and	my answering	wouldn't	do	either	of	us	any	good,	if	I	have	a	solution	I	don't	suppose it	would	be	yours.	Besides,	a	man	can't	save	his	brother,	and	not	even	a	father can	save	his	son	….	I've	nothing	to	tell	ye,	except,	maybe,	this:	don't	fear	and

don't	falter,	and	wherever	you	get	to,	remember	that	God	is	there.	David	is	out	of date	these	days,	and	very	likely	it	wasn't	David	at	all,	but	I	don't	know	anything truer	in	the	auld	book	than	yon	verse	where	it	says:	'Though	I	go	down	into	hell, Thou	art	there	also.'"

"I	beg	your	pardon,	padre,"	said	a	drawling	voice	behind	them.	"I	caught	a	word just	now	which	I	understand	no	decent	clergyman	uses	except	in	the	pulpit.	If, therefore,	you	are	preaching,	I	will	at	once	and	discreetly	withdraw,	but	if	not, for	his	very	morals'	sake,	I	will	withdraw	your	congregation—that	is,	if	he	hasn't forgotten	his	engagement."

Graham	jumped	up.	"Good	Heavens,	Pennell!"	he	exclaimed,	"I'm	blest	if	I hadn't."	He	pushed	his	arm	out	and	glanced	at	his	watch.	"Oh,	there's	plenty	of time,	anyway.	I'm	lunching	with	this	blighter	down	town,	padre,	at	some	special restaurant	of	his,"	he	explained,	"and	I	take	it	the	sum	and	substance	of	his unseemly	remarks	are	that	he	thinks	we	ought	to	get	a	move	on."

"Don't	let	me	stand	in	the	way	of	your	youthful	pleasures,"	said	Arnold,	smiling;

"but	take	care	of	yourself,	Graham.	Eat	and	drink,	for	to-morrow	you	die;	but don't	eat	and	drink	too	much	in	case	you	live	to	the	day	after."

"I'll	remember,"	said	Peter,	"but	I	hope	it	won't	be	necessary.	However,	you never	know	'among	the	multitude,'	do	you?"	he	added.

Arnold	caught	up	the	light	chair	and	lunged	out	at	him.	"Ye	unseemly	creature,"

he	shouted,	"get	out	of	it	and	leave	me	in	peace."

Pennell	and	Peter	left	the	camp	and	crossed	the	swing	bridge	into	the	maze	of docks.	Threading	their	way	along	as	men	who	knew	it	thoroughly	they	came	at length	to	the	main	roadway,	with	its	small,	rather	smelly	shops,	its	narrow	side-streets	almost	like	Edinburgh	closes,	and	its	succession	of	sheds	and	offices between	which	one	glimpsed	the	water.	Just	here,	the	war	had	made	a	difference.

There	was	less	pleasure	traffic	up	Seine	and	along	Channel,	though	the Southampton	packet	ran	as	regularly	as	if	no	submarine	had	ever	been	built.

Peter	liked	Pennell.	He	was	an	observant	creature	of	considerable	decencies,	and a	good	companion.	He	professed	some	religion,	and	although	it	was	neither profound	nor	apparently	particularly	vital,	it	helped	to	link	the	two	men.	As	they went	on,	the	shops	grew	a	little	better,	but	no	restaurant	was	visible	that	offered much	expectation.

"Where	in	the	world	are	you	taking	me?"	demanded	Peter.	"I	don't	mind	slums	in the	way	of	business,	but	I	prefer	not	to	go	to	lunch	in	them."

"Wait	and	see,	my	boy,"	returned	his	companion,	"and	don't	protest	till	it's	called for.	Even	then	wait	a	bit	longer,	and	your	sorrow	shall	be	turned	into	joy—and that's	Scripture.	Great	Scott!	see	what	comes	of	fraternising	with	padres! Now. "

So	saying	he	dived	in	to	the	right	down	a	dark	passage,	into	which	the	amazed Peter	followed	him.	He	had	already	opened	a	door	at	the	end	of	it	by	the	time Peter	got	there,	and	was	halfway	up	a	flight	of	wood	stairs	that	curved	up	in front	of	them	out	of	what	was,	obviously,	a	kitchen.	A	huge	man	turned	his	head as	Peter	came	in,	and	surveyed	him	silently,	his	hands	dexterously	shaking	a frying-pan	over	a	fire	as	he	did	so.

"Bon	jour,	monsieur,"	said	Peter	politely.

Monsieur	grunted,	but	not	unpleasantly,	and	Peter	gripped	the	banister	and commenced	to	ascend.	Half-way	up	he	was	nearly	sent	flying	down	again.	A rosy-cheeked	girl,	short	and	dark,	with	sparkling	eyes,	had	thrust	herself	down between	him	and	the	rail	from	a	little	landing	above,	and	was	shouting:

"Une	omelette	aux	champignons.	Jambon.	Pommes	sautes,	s'il	vous	plait."

Peter	recovered	himself	and	smiled.	"Bon	jour,	mademoiselle,"	he	said,	this	time.

In	point	of	fact,	he	could	say	very	little	else.

"Bon	jour,	monsieur,"	said,	the	girl,	and	something	else	that	he	could	not	catch, but	by	this	time	he	had	reached	the	top	in	time	to	witness	a	little	'business'	there.

A	second	girl,	taller,	older,	slower,	but	equally	smiling,	was	taking	Pennell's	cap and	stick	and	gloves,	making	play	with	her	eyes	the	while.	"Merci,	chérie,"	he heard	his	friend	say	and	then,	in	a	totally	different	voice:	"Ah!	Bon	jour	Marie."

A	third	girl	was	before	them.	In	her	presence	the	other	two	withdrew.	She	was tall,	plain,	shrewd	of	face,	with	reddish	hair,	but	she	smiled	even	as	the	others.	It was	little	more	than	a	glance	that	Peter	got,	for	she	called	an	order	(at	which	the first	girl	again	disappeared	down	the	stairs)	greeted	Pennell,	replied	to	his question	that	there	were	two	places,	and	was	out	of	sight	again	in	the	room, seemingly	all	at	once.	He	too,	then,	surrendered	cap	and	stick,	and	followed	his companion	in.

There	were	no	more	than	four	tables	in	the	little	room—two	for	six,	and	two	for four	or	five.	Most	were	filled,	but	he	and	Pennell	secured	two	seats	with	their backs	to	the	wall	opposite	a	couple	of	Australian	officers	who	had	apparently just	commenced.	Peter's	was	by	the	window,	and	he	glanced	out	to	see	the	sunlit street	below,	the	wide	sparkling	harbour,	and	right	opposite	the	hospital	he	had now	visited	several	times	and	his	own	camp	near	it.	There	was	the	new	green	of spring	shoots	in	the	window-boxes,	snowy	linen	on	the	table,	a	cheerful	hum	of conversation	about	him,	and	an	oak-panelled	wall	behind	that	had	seen	the Revolution.

"Pennell,"	he	said,	"you're	a	marvel.	The	place	is	perfect."

By	the	time	they	had	finished	Peter	was	feeling	warmed	and	friendly,	the Australians	had	been	joined	to	their	company,	and	the	four	spent	an	idle afternoon	cheerfully	enough.	There	was	nothing	in	strolling	through	the	busy streets,	joking	a	little	over	very	French	picture	post-cards,	quizzing	the	passing girls,	standing	in	a	queue	at	Cox's,	and	finally	drawing	a	fiver	in	mixed	French notes,	or	in	wandering	through	a	huge	shop	of	many	departments	to	buy	some toilet	necessities.	But	it	was	good	fun.	There	was	a	comradeship,	a	youthfulness, carelessness,	about	it	all	that	gripped	Peter.	He	let	himself	go,	and	when	he	did so	he	was	a	good	companion.

One	little	incident	in	the	Grand	Magasin	completed	his	abandonment	to	the	day and	the	hour.	They	were	ostensibly	buying	a	shaving-stick,	but	at	the	moment were	cheerily	wandering	through	the	department	devoted	to	 lingerie.	The attendant	girls,	entirely	at	ease,	were	trying	to	persuade	the	taller	of	the	two Australians,	whom	his	friend	addressed	as	"Alex,"	to	buy	a	flimsy	lace nightdress	"for	his	fiancée,"	readily	pointing	out	that	he	would	find	no	difficulty in	getting	rid	of	it	elsewhere	if	he	had	not	got	such	a	desirable	possession,	when Peter	heard	an	exclamation	behind	him.

"Hullo!"	said	a	girl's	voice;	"fancy	finding	you	here!"	He	turned	quickly	and blushed.	Julie	laughed	merrily.

"Caught	out,"	she	said,	"Tell	me	what	you're	buying,	and	for	whom.	A	blouse,	a camisole,	or	worse?"

"I'm	not	buying,"	said	Peter,	recovering	his	ease.	"We're	just	strolling	round,	and that	girl	insists	that	my	friend	the	Australian	yonder	should	buy	a	nightie	for	his

fiancée.	He	says	he	hasn't	one,	so	she	is	persuading	him	that	he	can	easily	pick one	up.	What	do	you	think?"

She	glanced	over	at	the	little	group.	"Easier	than	some	people	I	know,	I	should think,"	she	said,	smiling,	taking	in	his	six	feet	of	bronzed	manhood.	"But	it's	no use	your	buying	it.	I	wear	pyjamas,	silk,	and	I	prefer	Venns'."

"I'll	remember,"	said	Peter.	"By	the	way,	I'm	coming	to	tea	again	to-morrow."

"That	will	make	three	times	this	week,"	she	said.	"But	I	suppose	you	will	go round	the	ward	first."	Then	quickly,	for	Peter	looked	slightly	unhappy:	"Next week	I've	a	whole	day	off."

"No?"	he	said	eagerly	"Oh,	do	let's	fix	something	up.	Will	you	come	out somewhere?"

Her	eyes	roved	across	to	Pennell,	who	was	bearing	down	upon	them.	"We'll	fix	it up	to-morrow,"	she	said.	"Bring	Donovan,	and	I'll	get	Tommy.	And	now introduce	me	nicely."

He	did	so,	and	she	talked	for	a	few	minutes,	and	then	went	off	to	join	some friends,	who	had	moved	on	to	another	department.	"By	Jove,"	said	Pennell,

"that's	some	girl!	I	see	now	why	you	are	so	keen	on	the	hospital,	old	dear.	Wish	I were	a	padre."

"I	shall	be	padre	in	…"	began	Alex,	but	Peter	cut	him	short.

"Oh,	Lord,"	he	said,	"I'm	tired	of	that!	Come	on	out	of	it,	and	let's	get	a	refresher somewhere.	What's	the	club	like	here?"

"Club's	no	good,"	said	Pennell.	"Let's	go	to	Travalini's	and	introduce	the	padre.

He's	not	been	there	yet."

"I	thought	everyone	knew	it,"	said	the	other	Australian—rather	contemptuously, Peter	thought.	What	with	one	thing	and	another,	he	felt	suddenly	that	he'd	like	to go.	He	remembered	how	nearly	he	had	gone	there	in	other	company.	"Come	on, then,"	he	said,	and	led	the	way	out.

There	was	nothing	in	Travalini's	to	distinguish	it	from	many	other	such	places—

indeed,	to	distinguish	it	from	the	restaurant	in	which	Peter,	Donovan,	and	the

girls	had	dined	ten	days	or	so	before,	except	that	it	was	bigger,	more	garish, more	expensive,	and,	consequently,	more	British	in	patronage.	The	restaurant was,	however,	separated	more	completely	from	the	drinking-lounge,	in	which, among	palms,	a	string-band	played.	There	was	an	hotel	above	besides,	and	that helped	business,	but	one	could	come	and	go	innocently	enough,	for	all	that	there was	"anything	a	gentleman	wants,"	as	the	headwaiter,	who	talked	English,	called himself	a	Belgian,	and	had	probably	migrated	from	over	the	Rhine,	said.

Everybody,	indeed,	visited	the	place	now	and	again.	Peter	and	his	friends	went	in between	the	evergreen	shrubs	in	their	pots,	and	through	the	great	glass	swing-door,	with	every	assurance.	The	place	seemed	fairly	full.	There	was	a	subdued hum	of	talk	and	clink	of	glasses;	waiters	hurried	to	and	fro;	the	band	was	tuning up.	British	uniforms	predominated,	but	there	were	many	foreign	officers	and	a few	civilians.	There	were	perhaps	a	couple	of	dozen	girls	scattered	about	the place	besides.

The	friends	found	a	corner	with	a	big	plush	couch	which	took	three	of	them,	and a	chair	for	Alex.	A	waiter	bustled	up	and	they	ordered	drinks,	which	came	on little	saucers	marked	with	the	price.	Peter	lay	back	luxuriously.

"Chin-chin,"	said	the	other	Australian,	and	the	others	responded.

"That's	good,"	said	Pennell.

"Not	so	many	girls	here	this	afternoon,"	remarked	Alex	carelessly.	"See,	Dick, there's	that	little	Levantine	with	the	thick	dark	hair.	She's	caught	somebody."

Peter	looked	across	in	the	direction	indicated.	The	girl,	in	a	cerise	costume	with a	big	black	hat,	short	skirt,	and	dainty	bag,	was	sitting	in	a	chair	halfway	on	to them	and	leaning	over	the	table	before	her.	As	he	watched,	she	threw	her	head back	and	laughed	softly.	He	caught	the	gleam	of	a	white	throat	and	of	dark	sloe eyes.

"She's	a	pretty	one,"	said	Pennell.	"God!	but	they're	queer	little	bits	of	fluff, these	girls.	It	beats	me	how	they're	always	gay,	and	always	easy	to	get	and	to leave.	And	they	get	rottenly	treated	sometimes."

"Yes	I'm	damned	if	I	understand	them,"	said	Alex.	"Now,	padre,	I'll	tell	you something	that's	more	in	your	way	than	mine,	and	you	can	see	what	you	make	of it.	I	was	in	a	maison	tolerée	the	other	day—you	know	the	sort	of	thing—and there	were	half	a	dozen	of	us	in	the	sitting-room	with	the	girls,	drinking	fizz.	I

had	a	little	bit	of	a	thing	with	fair	hair—she	couldn't	have	been	more	than seventeen	at	most,	I	reckon—with	a	laugh	that	did	you	good	to	hear,	and,	by gum!	we	wanted	to	be	cheered	just	then,	for	we	had	had	a	bit	of	a	gruelling	on the	Ancre	and	had	been	pulled	out	of	the	line	to	refit.	She	sat	there	with	an angel's	face,	a	chemise	transparent	except	where	it	was	embroidered,	and	not much	else,	and	some	of	the	women	were	fair	beasts.	Well,	she	moved	on	my knee,	and	I	spilt	some	champagne	and	swore—'Jesus	Christ!'	I	said.	Do	you know,	she	pushed	back	from	me	as	if	I	had	hit	her!	'Oh,	don't	say	His	Name!'	she said.	'Promise	me	you	won't	say	it	again.	Do	you	not	know	how	He	loved	us?'	I was	so	taken	aback	that	I	promised,	and	to	tell	you	the	truth,	padre,	I	haven't	said it	since.	What	do	you	think	of	that?"

Peter	shook	his	head	and	drained	his	glass.	He	couldn't	have	spoken	at	once;	the little	story,	told	in	such	a	place,	struck	him	so	much.	Then	he	asked:	"But	is	that all?	How	did	she	come	to	be	there?"

"Well,"	Alex	said,	"that's	just	as	strange.	Father	was	in	a	French	cavalry regiment,	and	got	knocked	out	on	the	Marne.	They	lived	in	Arras	before	the	war, and	you	can	guess	that	there	wasn't	much	left	of	the	home.	One	much	older	sister was	a	widow	with	a	big	family;	the	other	was	a	kid	of	ten	or	eleven,	so	this	one went	into	the	business	to	keep	the	family	going.	Fact.	The	mother	used	to	come and	see	her,	and	I	got	to	know	her.	She	didn't	seem	to	mind:	said	the	doctors looked	after	them	well,	and	the	girl	was	making	good	money.	Hullo!"	he	broke off,	"there's	Louise,"	and	to	Peter's	horror	he	half-rose	and	smiled	across	at	a	girl some	few	tables	away.

She	got	up	and	came	over,	beamed	on	them	all,	and	took	the	seat	Alex	vacated.

"Good-evening,"	she	said,	in	fair	English,	scrutinising	them.	"What	is	it	you	say,

'How's	things'?"

Alex	pressed	a	drink	on	her	and	beckoned	the	waiter.	She	took	a	syrup,	the	rest martinis.	Peter	sipped	his,	and	watched	her	talking	to	Alex	and	Pennell.	The other	Australian	got	up	and	crossed	the	room,	and	sat	down	with	some	other men.

The	stories	he	had	heard	moved	him	profoundly.	He	wondered	if	they	were	true, but	he	seemed	to	see	confirmation	in	the	girl	before	him.	Despite	some	making up,	it	was	a	clean	face,	if	one	could	say	so.	She	was	laughing	and	talking	with	all the	ease	in	the	world,	though	Peter	noticed	that	her	eyes	kept	straying	round	the

room.	Apparently	his	friends	had	all	her	attention,	but	he	could	see	it	was	not	so.

She	was	on	the	watch	for	clients,	old	or	new.	He	thought	how	such	a	girl	would have	disgusted	him	a	few	short	weeks	ago,	but	he	did	not	feel	disgusted	now.	He could	not.	He	did	not	know	what	he	felt.	He	wondered,	as	he	looked,	if	she	were one	of	"the	multitude,"	and	then	the	fragment	of	a	text	slipped	through	his	brain:

"The	Friend	of	publicans	and	sinners."	" The	Friend":	the	little	adjective	struck him	as	never	before.	Had	they	ever	had	another?	He	frowned	to	himself	at	the thought,	and	could	not	help	wondering	vaguely	what	his	Vicar	or	the	Canon would	have	done	in	Travalini's.	Then	he	wondered	instantly	what	that	Other would	have	done,	and	he	found	no	answer	at	all.

"Yes,	but	I	do	not	know	your	friend	yet,"	he	heard	the	girl	say,	and	saw	she	was being	introduced	to	Pennell.	She	held	out	a	decently	gloved	hand	with	a	gesture that	startled	him—it	was	so	like	Hilda's.	Hilda!	The	comparison	dazed	him.	He fancied	he	could	see	her	utter	disgust,	and	then	he	involuntarily	shook	his	head; it	would	be	too	great	for	him	to	imagine.	What	would	she	have	made	of	the	story he	had	just	heard?	He	concluded	she	would	flatly	disbelieve	it….

But	Julie?	He	smiled	to	himself,	and	then,	for	the	first	time,	suddenly	asked himself	what	he	really	felt	towards	Julie.	He	remembered	that	first	night	and	the kiss,	and	how	he	had	half	hated	it,	half	liked	it.	He	felt	now,	chiefly,	anger	that Donovan	had	had	one	too.	One?	But	he,	Peter,	had	had	two….	Then	he	called himself	a	damned	fool;	it	was	all	of	a	piece	with	her	extravagant	and	utterly unconventional	madness.	But	what,	then,	would	she	say	to	this?	Had	she anything	in	common	with	it?

He	played	with	that	awhile,	blowing	out	thoughtful	rings	of	smoke.	It	struck	him that	she	had,	but	he	was	fully	aware	that	that	did	not	disgust	him	in	the	least.	It almost	fascinated	him,	just	as—that	 was	it—Hilda's	disgust	would	repel	him.

Why?	He	hadn't	an	idea.

"Monsieur	le	Capitaine	is	very	dull,"	said	a	girl's	voice	at	his	elbow.	He	started: Louise	had	moved	to	the	sofa	and	was	smiling	at	him.	He	glanced	towards	his companions,	Alex	was	standing,	finishing	a	last	drink;	Pennell	staring	at	Louise.

He	looked	back	at	the	girl,	straight	into	her	eyes,	and	could	not	read	them	in	the least.	The	darkened	eyebrows	and	the	glitter	in	them	baffled	him.	But	he	must speak,	"Am	I?"	he	said.	"Forgive	me,	mademoiselle;	I	was	thinking."

"Of	your	fiancée—is	it	not	so?	Ah!	The	Capitaine	has	his	fiancée,	then?	In England?	Ah,	well,	the	girls	in	England	do	not	suffer	like	we	girls	in	France….

They	are	proud,	too,	the	English	misses.	I	know,	for	I	have	been	there,	to—how do	you	call	it?—Folkestone.	They	walk	with	the	head	in	the	air,"	and	she	tilted up	her	chin	so	comically	that	Peter	smiled	involuntarily.

"No,	I	do	not	like	them,"	went	on	the	girl	deliberately.	"They	are	only	half	alive, I	think.	I	almost	wish	the	Boche	had	been	in	your	land….	They	are	cold,	la!	And not	so	very	nice	to	kiss,	eh?"

"They're	not	all	like	that,"	said	Pennell.

"Ah,	non?	But	you	like	the	girls	of	France	the	best,	mon	ami;	is	it	not	so?"	She leaned	across	towards	him	significantly.

Pennell	laughed.	" Now,	yes,	perhaps,"	he	said	deliberately;	"but	after	the	war	…"

and	he	shrugged	his	shoulders,	like	a	Frenchman.

A	shade	passed	over	the	girl's	face,	and	she	got	up.	"It	is	so,"	she	said	lightly.

"Monsieur	speaks	very	true—oh,	very	true!	The	girls	of	France	now—they	are gay,	they	are	alive,	they	smile,	and	it	is	war,	and	you	men	want	these	things.	But after—oh,	I	know	you	English—you'll	go	home	and	be—how	do	you	say?

—'respectable,'	and	marry	an	English	miss,	and	have—oh!	many,	many	bébés, and	wear	the	top-hat,	and	go	to	church.	There	is	no	country	like	England…."	She made	a	little	gesture.	"What	do	you	believe,	you	English?	In	le	bon	Dieu?	Non.

In	love?	Ah,	non!	In	what,	then?	Je	ne	sais!"	She	laughed	again.	"What	'ave	I said?	Forgive	me,	monsieur,	and	you	also,	Monsieur	le	Capitaine.	But	I	do	see	a friend	of	mine.	See,	I	go!	Bon	soir."

She	looked	deliberately	at	Peter	a	moment,	then	smiled	comprehensively	and	left them.	Peter	saw	that	Alex	had	gone	already;	he	asked	no	questions,	but	looked	at Pennell	inquiringly.

"I	think	so,	padre;	I've	had	enough	of	it	to-night.	Let's	clear.	We	can	get	back	in time	for	mess."

They	went	out	into	the	darkening	streets,	crossed	an	open	square,	and	turned down	a	busy	road	to	the	docks.	They	walked	quickly,	but	Peter	seemed	to himself	conscious	of	everyone	that	passed.	He	scanned	faces,	as	if	to	read	a riddle	in	them.	There	were	men	who	lounged	by,	gay,	reckless,	out	for	fun

plainly,	but	without	any	other	sinister	thought,	apparently.	There	were	Tommies who	saluted	and	trudged	on	heavily.	There	were	a	couple	of	Yorkshire	boys	who did	not	notice	them,	flushed,	animal,	making	determinedly	for	a	destination down	the	street.	There	was	one	man	at	least	who	passed	walking	alone,	with	a tense,	greedy,	hard	face,	and	Peter	all	but	shuddered.

The	lit	shops	gave	way	to	a	railed	space,	dark	by	contrast,	and	a	tall	building	of old	blackened	stone,	here	and	there	chipped	white,	loomed	up.	Moved	by	an impulse,	Peter	paused,	"Let's	see	if	it's	open,	Pennell,"	he	said.	"Do	you	mind?	I won't	be	a	second."

"Not	a	scrap,	old	man,"	said	Pennell,	"I'll	come	in	too."

Peter	walked	up	to	a	padded	leather-covered	door	and	pushed.	It	swung	open.

They	stepped	in,	into	a	faintly	broken	silence,	and	stood	still.

Objects	loomed	up	indistinctly—great	columns,	altars,	pews.	Far	away	a	light flickered	and	twinkled,	and	from	the	top	of	the	aisle	across	the	church	from	the door	by	which	they	had	entered	a	radiance	glowed	and	lost	itself	in	the	black spaces	of	the	high	roof	and	wide	nave.	Peter	crossed	towards	that	side,	and	his companion	followed.	They	trod	softly,	like	good	Englishmen	in	church,	and	they moved	up	the	aisle	a	little	to	see	more	clearly;	and	so,	having	reached	a	place from	which	much	was	visible,	remained	standing	for	a	few	seconds.

The	light	streamed	from	an	altar,	and	from	candles	above	it	set	around	a	figure	of the	Mother	of	God.	In	front	knelt	a	priest,	and	behind	him,	straggling	back	in	the pews,	a	score	or	so	of	women,	some	children,	and	a	blue-coated	French	soldier or	two.	The	priest's	voice	sounded	thin	and	low:	neither	could	hear	what	he	said; the	congregation	made	rapid	responses	regularly,	but	eliding	the,	to	them, familiar	words.	There	was,	then,	the	murmur	of	repeated	prayer,	like	muffled knocking	on	a	door,	and	nothing	more.

"Let's	go,"	whispered	Pennell	at	last.

They	went	out,	and	shut	the	door	softly	behind	them.	As	they	did	so,	some	other door	was	opened	noisily	and	banged,	while	footsteps	began	to	drag	slowly across	the	stone	floor	and	up	the	aisle	they	had	come	down.	The	new-comer subsided	into	a	pew	with	a	clatter	on	the	boards,	but	the	murmured	prayers	went on	unbroken.

Outside	the	street	engulfed	them.	The	same	faces	passed	by.	A	street-car	banged and	clattered	up	towards	the	centre	of	the	town,	packed	with	jovial	people.

Pennell	looked	towards	it	half	longingly.	"Great	Scott,	Graham!	I	wish,	now,	we hadn't	come	away	so	soon,"	he	said.





CHAPTER	VIII

The	lower	valley	of	the	Seine	is	one	of	the	most	beautiful	and	interesting	river-stretches	in	Northern	Europe.	It	was	the	High	Street	of	old	Normandy,	and	feuda, barons	and	medieval	monks	have	left	their	mark	upon	it.	From	the	castle	of Tancarville	to	the	abbey	of	Jumièges	you	can	read	the	story	of	their	doings;	or when	you	stand	in	the	Roman	circus	at	Lillebonne,	or	enter	the	ancient	cloister of	M.	Maeterlinck's	modern	residence	at	St.	Wandrille,	see	plainly	enough	the writing	of	a	still	older	legend,	such	as	appeared,	once,	on	the	wall	of	a	palace	in Babylon.	On	the	left	bank	steep	hills,	originally	wholly	clothed	with	forest	and still	thickly	wooded,	run	down	to	the	river	with	few	breaks	in	them,	each	break, however,	being	garrisoned	by	an	ancient	town.	Of	these,	Caudebec	stands unrivalled.	On	the	right	bank	the	flat	plain	of	Normandy	stretches	to	the	sky-line, pink-and-white	in	spring	with	miles	of	apple-orchards.	The	white	clouds	chase across	its	fair	blue	sky,	driven	by	the	winds	from	the	sea,	and	tall	poplars	rise	in their	uniform	rows	along	the	river	as	if	to	guard	a	Paradise.

Caudebec	can	be	reached	from	Le	Havre	in	a	few	hours,	and	although	cars	for hire	and	petrol	were	not	abundant	in	France	at	the	time,	one	could	find	a chauffeur	to	make	the	journey	if	one	was	prepared	to	pay.	Given	fine	weather,	it was	an	ideal	place	for	a	day	off	in	the	spring.	And	Peter	knew	it.

In	the	Grand	Magasin	Julie	had	talked	of	a	day	off,	and	a	party	of	four	had	been mooted,	but	when	he	had	leisure	to	think	of	it,	Peter	found	himself	averse	to four,	and	particularly	if	one	of	the	four	were	to	be	Donovan.	He	admitted	it freely	to	himself.	Donovan	was	the	kind	of	a	man,	he	thought,	that	Julie	must like,	and	he	was	the	kind	of	man,	too,	to	put	him,	Peter,	into	the	shade.

Ordinarily	he	asked	for	no	better	companion,	but	he	hated	to	see	Julie	and	Jack together.	He	could	not	make	the	girl	out,	and	he	wanted	to	do	so.	He	wanted	to know	what	she	thought	about	many	things,	and—incidentally,	of	course—what she	thought	about	him.

He	had	argued	all	this	over	next	morning	while	shaving,	and	had	ended	by cutting	himself.	It	was	a	slight	matter,	but	it	argued	a	certain	absent-mindedness, and	it	brought	him	back	to	decency.	He	perceived	that	he	was	scheming	to	leave his	friend	out,	and	he	fought	resolutely	against	the	idea.	Therefore,	that afternoon,	he	went	to	the	hospital,	spent	a	couple	of	hours	chatting	with	the	men, and	finally	wound	up	in	the	nurses'	mess-room	for	tea	as	usual.	It	was	a	little room,	long	and	narrow,	at	the	end	of	the	biggest	ward,	but	its	windows	looked over	the	sea	and	it	was	convenient	to	the	kitchen.	Coloured	illustrations	cut	from magazines	and	neatly	mounted	on	brown	paper	decorated	the	walls,	but	there was	little	else	by	way	of	furniture	or	ornament	except	a	long	table	and	chairs.

One	could	get	but	little	talk	except	of	a	scrappy	kind,	for	nurses	came continually	in	and	out	for	tea,	and,	indeed,	Julie	had	only	a	quarter	of	an	hour	to spare.	But	he	got	things	fixed	up	for	the	following	Thursday,	and	he	left	the place	to	settle	with	Donovan.

That	gentleman's	company	of	native	labour	was	lodged	a	mile	or	so	through	the docks	from	Peter's	camp,	on	the	banks	of	the	Tancarville	Canal.	It	was	enlivened at	frequent	intervals,	day	and	night,	by	the	sirens	of	tugs	bringing	strings	of barges	to	the	docks,	whence	their	cargo	was	borne	overseas	in	the	sea-going tramps,	or,	of	course,	taking	equally	long	strings	to	the	Seine	for	Rouen	and Paris.	It	was	mud	and	cinders	underfoot,	and	it	was	walled	off	with	corrugated-iron	sheeting	and	barbed	wire	from	the	attentions	of	some	hundreds	of	Belgian refugees	who	lived	along	the	canal	and	parallel	roads	in	every	conceivable	kind of	resting-place,	from	ancient	bathing-vans	to	broken-down	railway-trucks.	But there	were	trees	along	the	canal	and	reeds	and	grass,	so	that	there	were	worse places	than	Donovan's	camp	in	Le	Havre.

Peter	found	his	friend	surveying	the	endeavours	of	a	gang	of	boys	to	construct	a raised	causeway	from	the	officers'	mess	to	the	orderly-room,	and	he	promptly broached	his	object.	Donovan	was	entranced	with	the	proposal,	but	he	could	not go.	He	was	adamant	upon	it.	He	could	possibly	have	got	off,	but	it	meant	leaving his	something	camp	for	a	whole	day,	and	just	at	present	he	couldn't.	Peter	could get	Pennell	or	anyone.	Another	time,	perhaps,	but	not	now.	For	thus	can	the	devil trap	his	victims.

Peter	pushed	back	for	home	on	his	bicycle,	but	stopped	at	the	docks	on	his	way to	look	up	Pennell.	That	gentleman	was	bored,	weary,	and	inclined	to	be blasphemous.	It	appeared	that	for	the	whole,	infernal	day	he	had	had	to	watch the	off-loading	of	motor-spares,	that	he	had	had	no	lunch,	and	that	he	could	not

get	away	for	a	day	next	week	if	he	tried.	"It	isn't	everyone	can	get	a	day	off whenever	he	wants	to,	padre,"	he	said.	"In	the	next	war	I	shall	be	…"	Peter turned	hard	on	his	heel,	and	left	him	complaining	to	the	derricks.

He	was	now	all	but	cornered.	There	was	nobody	else	he	particularly	cared	to	ask unless	it	were	Arnold,	and	he	could	not	imagine	Arnold	and	Julie	together.	It appeared	to	him	that	fate	was	on	his	side;	it	only	remained	to	persuade	Julie	to come	alone.	He	pedalled	back	to	mess	and	dinner,	and	then,	about	half-past eight,	strolled	round	to	the	hospital	again.	It	was	late,	of	course,	but	he	was	a padre,	and	the	hospital	padre,	and	privileged.	He	knew	exactly	what	to	do,	and that	he	was	really	as	safe	as	houses	in	doing	it,	and	yet	this	intriguing	by	night made	him	uncomfortable	still.	He	told	himself	he	was	an	ass	to	think	so,	but	he could	not	get	rid	of	the	sensation.

Julie	would	be	on	duty	till	9.30,	and	he	could	easily	have	a	couple	of	minutes'

conversation	with	her	in	the	ward.	He	followed	the	railway-track,	then,	along	the harbour,	and	went	in	under	the	great	roof	of	the	empty	station.	On	the	far platform	a	hospital	train	was	being	made	ready	for	its	return	run,	but,	except	for a	few	cleaners	and	orderlies,	the	place	was	empty.

An	iron	stairway	led	up	from	the	platform	to	the	wards	above.	He	ascended,	and found	himself	on	a	landing	with	the	door	of	the	theatre	open	before	him.	There was	a	light	in	it,	and	he	caught	the	sound	of	water;	some	pro.	was	cleaning	up.

He	moved	down	the	passage	and	cautiously	opened	the	door	of	the	ward.

It	was	shaded	and	still.	Somewhere	a	man	breathed	heavily,	and	another	turned in	his	sleep.	Just	beyond	the	red	glow	of	the	stove,	with	the	empty	armchairs	in	a circle	before	it,	were	screens	from	which	came	a	subdued	light.	He	walked	softly between	the	beds	towards	them,	and	looked	over	the	top.

Inside	was	a	little	sanctum:	a	desk	with	a	shaded	reading-lamp,	a	chair,	a	couch, a	little	table	with	flowers	upon	it	and	a	glass	and	jug,	and	on	the	floor	by	the couch	a	work-basket.	Julie	was	at	the	desk	writing	in	a	big	official	book,	and	he watched	her	for	a	moment	unobserved.	It	was	almost	as	if	he	saw	a	different person	from	the	girl	he	knew.	She	was	at	work,	and	a	certain	hidden	sadness showed	clearly	in	her	face.	But	the	little	brown	fringe	of	hair	on	her	forehead and	the	dimpled	chin	were	the	same….

"Good-evening,"	he	whispered.

She	looked	up	quickly,	with	a	start,	and	he	noticed	curiously	how	rapidly	the laughter	came	back	to	her	face.	"You	did	startle	me,	Solomon,"	she	said.	"What is	it?"

"I	want	to	speak	to	you	a	minute	about	Thursday,"	he	said.	"Can	I	come	in?"

She	got	up	and	came	round	the	screens.	"Follow	me,"	she	said,	"and	don't	make a	noise."

She	led	him	across	the	ward	to	the	wide	verandah,	opening	the	door	carefully and	leaving	it	open	behind	her,	and	then	walked	to	the	balustrade	and	glanced down.	The	hospital	ship	had	gone,	and	there	was	no	one	visible	on	the	wharf.

The	stars	were	hidden,	and	there	was	a	suggestion	of	mist	on	the	harbour, through	which	the	distant	lights	seemed	to	flicker.

"You're	coming	on,	Solomon,"	she	said	mockingly.	"Never	tell	me	you'd	have dared	to	call	on	the	hospital	to	see	a	nurse	by	night	a	few	weeks	ago!	Suppose matron	came	round?	There	is	no	dangerous	case	in	my	ward."

"Not	among	the	men,	perhaps,"	said	Peter	mischievously.	"But,	look	here,	about Thursday;	Donovan	can't	go,	nor	Pennell,	and	I	don't	know	anyone	else	I	want	to ask."

"Well,	I'll	see	if	I	can	raise	a	man.	One	or	two	of	the	doctors	are	fairly	decent,	or I	can	get	a	convalescent	out	of	the	officers'	hospital."

She	had	the	lights	behind	her,	and	he	could	not	see	her	face,	but	he	knew	she	was laughing	at	him,	and	it	spurred	him	on.	"Don't	rag,	Julie,"	he	said,	"You	know	I want	you	to	come	alone."

There	was	a	perceptible	pause.	Then:	"I	can't	cut	Tommy,"	she	said.

"Not	for	once?"	he	urged.	She	turned	away	from	him	and	looked	down	at	the water.	It	is	curious	how	there	come	moments	of	apprehension	in	all	our	lives when	we	want	a	thing,	but	know	quite	well	we	are	mad	to	want	it.	Julie	looked into	the	future	for	a	few	seconds,	and	saw	plainly,	but	would	not	believe	what she	saw.

When	she	turned	back	she	had	her	old	manner	completely.	"You're	a	dear	old thing,"	she	said,	"and	I'll	do	it.	But	if	it	gets	out	that	I	gadded	about	for	a	day

with	an	officer,	even	though	he	is	a	padre,	and	that	we	went	miles	out	of	town, there'll	be	some	row,	my	boy.	Quick	now!	I	must	get	back.	What's	the	plan?"

"Thanks	awfully,"	said	Peter.	"It	will	be	a	rag.	What	time	can	you	get	off?"

"Oh,	after	breakfast	easily—say	eight-thirty."

"Right.	Well,	take	the	tram-car	to	Harfleur—you	know?—as	far	as	it	goes.	I'll	be at	the	terminus	with	a	car.	What	time	must	you	be	in?"

"I	can	get	late	leave	till	ten,	I	think,"	she	said.

"Good!	That	gives	us	heaps	of	time.	We'll	lunch	and	tea	in	Caudebec,	and	have some	sandwiches	for	the	road	home."

"And	if	the	car	breaks	down?"

"It	won't,"	said	Peter.	"You're	lucky	in	love,	aren't	you?"

She	did	not	laugh.	"I	don't	know,"	she	said.	"Good-night."

And	then	Peter	had	walked	home,	thinking	of	Hilda.	And	he	had	sat	by	the	sea, and	come	to	the	conclusion	that	he	was	a	rotter,	but	in	the	web	of	Fate	and	much to	be	pitied,	which	is	like	a	man.	And	then	he	had	played	auction	till	midnight and	lost	ten	francs,	and	gone	to	bed	concluding	that	he	was	certainly	unlucky—

at	cards.

As	Peter	sat	in	his	car	at	the	Harfleur	terminus	that	Thursday	it	must	be confessed	that	he	was	largely	indifferent	to	the	beauties	of	the	Seine	Valley	that he	had	professedly	come	to	see.	He	was	nervous,	to	begin	with,	lest	he	should	be recognised	by	anyone,	and	he	was	in	one	of	his	troubled	moods.	But	he	had	not long	to	wait.	The	tram	came	out,	and	he	threw	away	his	cigarette	and	walked	to meet	the	passengers.

Julie	looked	very	smart	in	the	grey	with	its	touch	of	scarlet,	but	she	was discontented	with	it.	"If	only	I	could	put	on	a	few	glad	rags,"	she	said	as	she climbed	into	the	car,	"this	would	be	perfect.	You	men	can't	know	how	a	girl comes	to	hate	uniform.	It's	not	bad	occasionally,	but	if	you	have	to	wear	it always	it	spoils	chances.	But	I've	got	my	new	shoes	and	silk	stockings	on,"	she added,	sticking	out	a	neat	ankle,	"and	my	skirt	is	not	vastly	long,	is	it?	Besides,

underneath,	if	it's	any	consolation	to	you,	I've	really	pretty	things.	Uniform	or not,	I	see	no	reason	why	one	should	not	feel	joyful	next	the	skin.	What	do	you think?"

Peter	agreed	heartily,	and	tucked	a	rug	round	her.	"There's	the	more	need	for	this, then,"	he	said.

"Oh,	I	don't	know:	silk	always	makes	me	feel	so	comfortable	that	I	can't	be	cold.

Isn't	it	a	heavenly	day?	We	are	lucky,	you	know;	it	might	have	been	beastly.	Lor', but	I'm	going	to	enjoy	myself	to-day,	my	dear!	I	warn	you.	I've	got	to	forget	how Tommy	looked	when	I	put	her	off	with	excuses.	I	felt	positively	mean."

"What	did	she	say?"	asked	Peter.

"That	she	didn't	mind	at	all,	as	she	had	got	to	write	letters,"	said	Julie,	"Solomon, Tommy's	a	damned	good	sort!…	Give	us	a	cigarette,	and	don't	look	blue.	We're right	out	of	town."

Peter	got	out	his	case.	"Don't	call	me	Solomon	to-day,"	he	said.

Julie	threw	herself	back	in	her	corner	and	shrieked	with	laughter.	The	French chauffeur	glanced	round	and	grimaced	appreciatively,	and	Peter	felt	a	fool.

"What	am	I	to	call	you,	then?"	she	demanded.	"You	are	a	funny	old	thing,	and now	you	look	more	of	a	Solomon	than	ever."

"Call	me	Peter,"	he	said.

She	looked	at	him,	her	eyes	sparkling	with	amusement.	"I'm	really	beginning	to enjoy	myself,"	she	said.	"But,	look	here,	you	mustn't	begin	like	this.	How	in	the world	do	you	think	we	shall	end	up	if	you	do?	You'll	have	nothing	left	to	say, and	I	shall	be	worn	to	a	rag	and	a	temper	warding	off	your	sentimentality."

"Julie,"	said	Peter,	"are	you	ever	serious?	I	can't	help	it,	you	know,	I	suppose because	I	am	a	parson,	though	I	am	such	a	rotten	one."

"Who	says	you're	a	rotten	one?"

"Everybody	who	tells	the	truth,	and,	besides,	I	know	it.	I	feel	an	absolute stummer	when	I	go	around	the	wards.	I	never	can	say	a	word	to	the	men."

"They	like	you	awfully.	You	know	little	Jimmy,	that	kiddie	who	came	in	the other	day	who's	always	such	a	brick?	Well,	last	night	I	went	and	sat	with	him	a bit	because	he	was	in	such	pain.	I	told	him	where	I	was	going	to-day	as	a	secret.

What	do	you	think	he	said	about	you?"

"I	don't	want	to	know,"	said	Peter	hastily.

"Well,	you	shall.	He	said	if	more	parsons	were	like	you,	more	men	would	go	to church.	What	do	you	make	of	that,	old	Solomon?"

"It	isn't	true	to	start	with.	A	few	might	come	for	a	little,	but	they	would	soon	fall off.	And	if	they	didn't,	they'd	get	no	good.	I	don't	know	what	to	say	to	them."

Julie	threw	away	her	cigarette-stump.	"One	sees	a	lot	of	human	nature	in hospitals,	my	boy,"	she	said,	"and	it	doesn't	leave	one	with	many	illusions.	But from	what	I've	seen,	I	should	say	nobody	does	much	good	by	talking."

"You	don't	understand,"	said	Peter.	"Look	here,	I	shouldn't	call	you	religious	in	a way	at	all	Don't	be	angry.	I	don't	 know,	but	I	don't	think	so,	and	I	don't	think	you can	possibly	know	what	I	mean."

"I	used	to	do	the	flowers	in	church	regularly	at	home,"	she	said.	"I	believe	in God,	though	you	think	I	don't."

Peter	sighed.	"Let's	change	the	subject,"	he	said.	"Have	you	seen	any	more	of that	Australian	chap	lately?"

"Rather!	He's	engaged	to	a	girl	I	know,	and	I	reckon	I'm	doing	her	a	good	turn	by sticking	to	him.	He's	a	bit	of	a	devil,	you	know,	but	I	think	I	can	keep	him	off	the French	girls	a	bit."

Peter	looked	at	her	curiously.	"You	know	what	he	is,	and	you	don't	mind	then?"

he	said.

"Good	Lord,	no!"	she	replied.	"My	dear	boy,	I	know	what	men	are.	It	isn't	in their	nature	to	stick	to	one	girl	only.	He	loves	Edie	all	right,	and	he'll	make	her	a good	husband	one	day,	if	she	isn't	too	particular	and	inquisitive.	If	I	were married,	I'd	give	my	husband	absolute	liberty—and	I'd	expect	it	in	return.	But	I shall	never	marry.	There	isn't	a	man	who	can	play	fair.	They'll	take	their	own pleasures,	but	they	are	all	as	jealous	as	possible.	I've	seen	it	hundreds	of	times."

"You	amaze	me,"	said	Peter.	"Let's	talk	straight.	Do	you	mean	to	say	that	if	you were	married	and	your	husband	ran	up	to	Paris	for	a	fortnight,	and	you	knew exactly	what	he'd	gone	for,	you	wouldn't	mind?"

"No,"	she	declared	roundly.	"I	wouldn't.	He'd	come	back	all	the	more	fond	of me,	I'd	know	I'd	be	a	fool	to	expect	anything	else."

Peter	stared	at	her.	She	was	unlike	anything	he	had	ever	seen.	Her	moral standards,	if	she	had	any,	he	added	mentally,	were	so	different	from	his	own	that he	was	absolutely	floored.	He	thought	grimly	that	alone	in	a	motor-car	he	had got	among	the	multitude	with	a	vengeance.	"Have	you	ever	been	in	love?"	he demanded.

She	laughed.	"Solomon,	you're	the	quaintest	creature.	Do	you	think	I'd	tell	you	if I	had	been?	You	never	ought	to	ask	anyone	that.	But	if	you	want	to	know,	I've been	in	love	hundreds	of	times.	It's	a	queer	disease,	but	not	serious—at	least,	not if	you	don't	take	it	too	seriously."

"You	don't	know	what	love	is	at	all,"	he	said.

She	faced	him	fairly	and	unashamed.	"I	do,"	she	said,	"It's	an	animal	passion	for the	purpose	of	populating	the	earth.	And	if	you	ask	me,	I	think	it	is	rather	a	dirty trick	on	the	part	of	God."

"You	don't	mean	that,"	he	said,	distressed.

She	laughed	again	merrily,	and	slipped	her	hand	into	his	under	the	rug.	"Peter,"

she	said—"there,	am	I	not	good?	You	aren't	made	to	worry	about	these	things.	I don't	know	that	anyone	is.	We	can't	help	ourselves,	and	the	best	thing	is	to	take our	pleasures	when	we	can	find	them.	I	suppose	you'll	be	shocked	at	me,	but	I'm not	going	to	pretend.	I	wasn't	built	that	way.	If	this	were	a	closed	car	I'd	give	you a	kiss."

"I	don't	want	that	sort	of	a	kiss,"	he	said.	"That	was	what	you	gave	me	the	other night.	I	want…."

"You	don't	know	what	you	want,	my	dear,	though	you	think	you	do.	You shouldn't	be	so	serious.	I'm	sure	I	kiss	very	nicely—plenty	of	men	think	so?

anyway,	and	if	there	is	nothing	in	that	sort	of	kiss,	why	not	kiss?	Is	there	a Commandment	against	it?	I	suppose	our	grandmothers	thought	so,	but	we	don't.

Besides,	I've	been	east	of	Suez,	where	there	ain't	no	ten	Commandments.	There's only	one	real	rule	left	in	life	for	most	of	us,	Peter,	and	that's	this:	'Be	a	good	pal, and	don't	worry.'"

Peter	sighed.	"You	and	I	were	turned	out	differently,	Julie,"	he	said.	"But	I	like you	awfully.	You	attract	me	so	much	that	I	don't	know	how	to	express	it.	There's nothing	mean	about	you,	and	nothing	sham.	And	I	admire	your	pluck	beyond words.	It	seems	to	me	that	you've	looked	life	in	the	face	and	laughed.	Anybody can	laugh	at	death,	but	very	few	of	us	at	life.	I	think	I'm	terrified	of	it.	And	that's the	awful	part	about	it	all,	for	I	ought	to	know	the	secret,	and	I	don't.	I	feel	an absolute	hypocrite	at	times—when	I	take	a	service,	for	example.	I	talk	about things	I	don't	understand	in	the	least,	even	about	God,	and	I	begin	to	think	I know	nothing	about	Him…."	He	broke	off,	utterly	miserable.

"Poor	old	boy,"	she	said	softly;	"is	it	as	bad	as	that?"

He	turned	to	her	fiercely.	"You	darling!"	he	said,	carried	away	by	her	tone.	"I believe	I'd	rather	have	you	than—than	God!"

She	did	not	move	in	her	corner,	nor	did	she	smile	now.	"I	wonder,"	she	said slowly.	"Peter,	it's	you	that	hate	shams,	not	I.	It's	you	that	are	brave,	not	I.	I	play with	shams	because	I	know	they're	shams,	but	I	like	playing	with	them.	But	you are	greater	than	I.	You	are	not	content	with	playing.	One	of	these	days—oh,	I don't	know…."	She	broke	off	and	looked	away.

Peter	gripped	her	hand	tightly.	"Don't,	little	girl,"	he	said.	"Let's	forget	for	to-day.

Look	at	those	primroses;	they're	the	first	I've	seen.	Aren't	they	heavenly?"

They	ran	into	Caudebec	in	good	time,	and	lunched	at	an	hotel	overlooking	the river,	with	great	enthusiasm.	To	Peter	it	was	utterly	delicious	to	have	her	by	him.

She	was	as	gay	as	she	could	possibly	be,	and	made	fun	over	everything.	Sitting daintily	before	him,	her	daring,	unconventional	talk	carried	him	away.	She	chose the	wine,	and	after	 dèjeuner	sat	with	her	elbows	on	the	table,	puffing	at	a cigarette,	her	brown	eyes	alight	with	mischief,	apparently	without	a	thought	for to-morrow.

"Oh,	I	say,"	she	said,	"do	look	at	that	party	in	the	corner.	The	old Major's	well	away,	and	the	girl'll	have	a	job	to	keep	him	in	hand,	I wonder	where	they're	from?	Rouen,	perhaps;	there	was	a	car	at	the	door.

What	do	you	think	of	the	girl?"

Peter	glanced	back.	"No	better	than	she	ought	to	be,"	he	said.

"No,	I	don't	suppose	so,	but	they	are	gay,	these	French	girls.	I	don't	wonder	men like	them.	And	they	have	a	hard	time.	I'd	give	them	a	leg	up	any	day	if	I	could.	I can't,	though,	so	if	ever	you	get	a	chance	do	it	for	me,	will	you?"

Peter	assented.	"Come	on,"	he	said.	"Finish	that	glass	if	you	think	you	can,	and let's	get	out."

"Here's	the	best,	then,	I've	done.	What	are	we	going	to	see?"

For	a	couple	of	hours	they	wandered	round	the	old	town,	with	its	narrow	streets and	even	fifteenth-century	houses,	whose	backs	actually	leaned	over	the	swift little	river	that	ran	all	but	under	the	place	to	the	Seine.	They	penetrated	through an	old	mill	to	its	back	premises,	and	climbed	precariously	round	the	water-wheel to	reach	a	little	moss-grown	platform	from	which	the	few	remaining	massive stones	of	the	Norman	wall	and	castle	could	still	be	seen.	The	old	abbey	kept them	a	good	while,	Julie	interested	Peter	enormously	as	they	walked	about	its cool	aisles,	and	tried	to	make	out	the	legends	of	its	ancient	glass.	She	had nothing	of	that	curious	kind	of	shyness	most	people	have	in	a	church,	and	that	he would	certainly	have	expected	of	her.	She	joked	and	laughed	a	little	in	it—at	a queer	row	of	mutilated	statues	packed	into	a	kind	of	chapel	to	keep	quiet	out	of the	way	till	wanted,	at	the	vivid	red	of	the	Red	Sea	engulfing	Pharaoh	and	all	his host—but	not	in	the	least	irreverently.	He	recalled	a	saying	of	a	book	he	had once	read	in	which	a	Roman	Catholic	priest	had	defended	the	homeliness	of	an Italian	congregation	by	saying	that	it	was	right	for	them	to	be	at	home	in	their Father's	House.	It	was	almost	as	if	Julie	were	at	home,	yet	he	shrank	from	the inference.

She	was	entirely	ignorant	of	everything,	except	perhaps,	of	a	little	biblical history,	but	she	made	a	most	interested	audience.	Once	he	thought	she	was perhaps	egging	him	on	for	his	own	pleasure,	but	when	he	grew	more	silent	she urged	him	to	explain.	"It's	ripping	going	round	with	somebody	who	knows something,"	she	said.	"Most	of	the	men	one	meets	know	absolutely	nothing.

They're	very	jolly,	but	one	gets	tired.	I	could	listen	to	you	for	ages."

Peter	assured	her	that	he	was	almost	as	ignorant	as	they,	but	she	was	shrewdly insistent.	"You	read	more,	and	you	understand	what	you	read,"	she	said.	"Most people	don't.	I	know."

They	bought	picture	post-cards	off	a	queer	old	woman	in	a	peasant	head-dress, and	then	came	back	to	the	river	and	sat	under	the	shade	of	a	line	of	great	trees	to wait	for	the	tea	the	hotel	had	guaranteed	them.	Julie	now	did	all	the	talking—of South	Africa,	of	gay	adventures	in	France	and	on	the	voyage,	and	of	the	men	she had	met.	She	was	as	frank	as	possible,	but	Peter	wondered	how	far	he	was getting	to	know	the	real	girl.

Tea	was	an	unusual	success	for	France.	It	was	real	tea,	but	then	there	was	reason for	that,	for	Julie	had	insisted	on	going	into	the	big	kitchen,	to	madame's amusement	and	monsieur's	open	admiration,	and	making	it	herself.	But	the chocolate	cakes,	the	white	bread	and	proper	butter,	and	the	cream,	were	a miracle.	Peter	wondered	if	you	could	get	such	things	in	England	now,	and	Julie gaily	told	him	that	the	French	made	laws	only	to	break	them,	with	several instances	thereof.	She	declared	that	if	a	food-ration	officer	existed	in	Caudebec he	must	be	in	love	with	the	landlady's	daughter	and	that	she	only	wished	she could	get	to	know	such	an	official	in	Havre.	The	daughter	in	question	waited	on them,	and	Julie	and	she	chummed	up	immensely.	Finally	she	was	despatched	to produce	a	collection	of	Army	badges	and	buttons—scalps	Julie	called	them.

When	they	came	they	turned	them	over.	All	ranks	were	represented,	or	nearly	so, and	most	regiments	that	either	could	remember.	There	were	Canadian, Australian,	and	South	African	badges,	and	at	last	Julie	declared	that	only	one was	wanting.

"What	will	you	give	for	this	officer's	badge?"	she	demanded,	seizing	hold	of	one of	Peter's	Maltese	crosses.

The	girl	looked	at	it	curiously.	"What	is	it?"	she	said.

"It's	the	badge	of	the	Sacred	Legion,"	said	Julie	gravely.	"You	know	Malta?

Well,	that's	part	of	the	British	Empire,	of	course,	and	the	English	used	to	have	a regiment	there	to	defend	it	from	the	Turks.	It	was	a	great	honour	to	join,	and	so	it was	called	the	Sacred	Legion.	This	officer	is	a	Captain	in	it."

"Shut	up	Julie,"	said	Peter, sotto	voce.

But	nothing	would	stop	her.	"Come	now,"	she	said.	"What	will	you	give?

You'll	give	her	one	for	a	kiss,	won't	you,	Solomon?"

The	girl	laughed	and	blushed	"Not	before	mademoiselle,"	she	said,	looking	at Peter.

"Oh,	I'm	off,"	cried	Julie,	"I'll	spare	you	one,	but	only	one,	remember."	and	she deliberately	got	up	and	left	them.

Mademoiselle	was	"tres	jolie,"	said	the	girl,	collecting	her	badges.	Peter detached	a	cross	and	gave	it	her,	and	she	demurely	put	up	her	mouth.	He	kissed her	lightly,	and	walked	leisurely	out	to	settle	the	bill	and	call	the	car.	He	had entirely	forgotten	his	depression,	and	the	world	seemed	good	to	him.	He hummed	a	little	song	by	the	water's	edge	as	he	waited,	and	thought	over	the	day.

He	could	never	remember	having	had	such	a	one	in	his	life.	Then	he	recollected that	one	badge	was	gone,	and	he	abstracted	the	other.	Without	his	badges	he would	not	be	known	as	a	chaplain.

When	Julie	appeared,	she	made	no	remark,	as	he	had	half-expected.	They	got	in, and	started	off	back	in	the	cooling	evening.	Near	Tancarville	they	stopped	the	car to	have	the	hood	put	up,	and	strolled	up	into	the	grounds	of	the	old	castle	while they	waited.

"Extraordinary	it	must	have	been	to	have	lived	in	a	place	like	this,"	said	Peter.

"Rather,"	said	Julie,	"and	beyond	words	awful	to	the	women.	I	cannot	imagine what	they	must	have	been	like,	but	I	think	they	must	have	been	something	like native	African	women."

"Why?"	queried	Peter.

"Oh,	because	a	native	woman	never	reads	and	hardly	goes	five	miles	from	her village.	She	is	a	human	animal,	who	bears	children	and	keeps	the	house	of	her master,	that's	all.	That's	what	these	women	must	have	done."

"The	Church	produced	some	different	types,"	said	Peter;	"but	they	had	no	chance elsewhere,	perhaps.	Still,	I	expect	they	were	as	happy	as	we,	perhaps	happier."

"And	their	cows	were	happier	still,	I	should	think,"	laughed	Julie.	"No,	you	can't persuade	me.	I	wouldn't	have	been	a	woman	in	those	days	for	the	world."

"And	now?"	asked	Peter.

"Rather!	We	have	much	the	best	time	on	the	whole.	We	can	do	what	we	like pretty	well.	If	we	want	to	be	men,	we	can.	We	can	put	on	riding-breeches,	even, and	run	a	farm.	But	if	we	like,	we	can	wear	glad	rags	and	nice	undies,	and	be

more	women	than	ever."

"And	in	the	end	thereof?"	Peter	couldn't	help	asking.

"Oh,"	said	Julie	lightly,	"one	can	settle	down	and	have	babies	if	one	wants	to.

And	sit	in	a	drawing-room	and	talk	scandal	as	much	as	one	likes.	Not	that	I	shall do	either,	thank	you.	I	shall—oh,	I	don't	know	what	I	shall	do.	Solomon,	you	are at	your	worst.	Pick	me	some	of	those	primroses,	and	let's	be	going.	You	never can	tell:	we	may	have	to	walk	home	yet."

Peter	plucked	a	few	of	the	early	blooms,	and	she	pushed	them	into	her	waist-belt.	Then	they	went	back	to	the	car,	and	got	in	again.

"Cold?"	he	asked,	after	a	little.

"A	bit,"	she	said.	"Tuck	me	up,	and	don't	sit	in	that	far	corner	all	the	time.	You make	me	feel	chilly	to	look	at	you.	I	hate	sentimental	people,	but	if	you	tried hard	and	were	nice	I	could	work	up	quite	a	lot	of	sentiment	just	now."

He	laughed,	and	tucked	her	up	as	required.	Then	he	lit	a	cigarette	and	slipped	his arm	round	her	waist.	"Is	that	better?"	he	said.

"Much.	But	you	can't	have	had	much	practice.	Now	tell	me	stories."

Peter	had	a	mind	to	tell	her	several,	but	he	refrained,	and	they	grew	silent,	"Do you	think	we	shall	have	another	day	like	this?"	he	demanded,	after	a	little.

"I	don't	see	why	not,"	she	said.	"But	one	never	knows,	does	one?	The	chances are	we	shan't.	It's	a	queer	old	world."

"Let's	try,	anyway;	I've	loved	it,"	he	said.

"So	have	I,"	said	Julie.	"It's	the	best	day	I've	had	for	a	long	time,	Peter.	You're	a nice	person	to	go	out	with,	you	know,	though	I	mustn't	flatter	you	too	much.	You should	develop	the	gift;	it's	not	everyone	that	has	it."

"I've	no	wish	to,"	he	said.

"You	are	an	old	bear,"	she	laughed;	"but	you	don't	mean	all	you	say,	or	rather you	do,	for	you	will	say	what	you	mean.	You	shouldn't,	Peter.	It's	not	done

nowadays,	and	it	gives	one	away.	If	you	were	like	me,	now,	you	could	say	and do	anything	and	nobody	would	mind.	They'd	never	know	what	you	meant,	and of	course	all	the	time	you'd	mean	nothing."

"So	you	mean	nothing	all	the	time?"	he	queried.

"Of	course,"	she	said	merrily.	"What	do	you	think?"

That	jarred	Peter	a	little,	so	he	said	nothing	and	silence	fell	on	them,	and	at	the Hôtel	de	Ville	in	the	city	he	asked	if	she	would	mind	finishing	alone.

"Not	a	bit,	old	thing,	if	you	want	to	go	anywhere,"	she	said.

He	apologised.	"Arnold—he's	our	padre—is	likely	to	be	at	the	club,	and	I promised	I'd	walk	home	with	him,"	he	lied	remorselessly.	"It's	beastly	rude,	I know,	but	I	thought	you'd	understand."

She	looked	at	him,	and	laughed.	"I	believe	I	do,"	she	said.

He	stopped	the	car	and	got	out,	settling	with	the	man,	and	glancing	up	at	a	clock.

"You'll	be	in	at	nine-forty-five,"	he	said,	"as	proper	as	possible.	And	thank	you so	much	for	coming."

"Thank	you,	Solomon,"	she	replied.	"It's	been	just	topping.	Thanks	awfully	for taking	me.	And	come	in	to	tea	soon,	won't	you?"	He	promised	and	held	out	his hand.	She	pressed	it,	and	waved	out	of	the	window	as	the	car	drove	off.	And	no sooner	was	it	in	motion	than	he	cursed	himself	for	a	fool.	Yet	he	knew	why	he had	done	as	he	had,	there,	in	the	middle	of	the	town.	He	knew	that	he	feared	she would	kiss	him	again—as	before.

Not	noticing	where	he	went,	he	set	off	through	the	streets,	making, unconsciously	almost,	for	the	sea,	and	the	dark	boulevards	that	led	from	the gaily	lit	centre	of	the	city	towards	it.	He	walked	slowly,	his	mind	a	chaos	of thoughts,	and	so	ran	into	a	curious	adventure.

As	he	passed	a	side-street	he	heard	a	man's	uneven	steps	on	the	pavement,	a girl's	voice,	a	curse,	and	the	sound	of	a	fall.	Then	followed	an	exclamation	in another	woman's	voice,	and	a	quick	sentence	in	French.

Peter	hesitated	a	minute,	and	then	turned	down	the	road	to	where	a	small	group

was	faintly	visible.	As	he	reached	it,	he	saw	that	a	couple	of	street	girls	were bending	over	a	man	who	lay	sprawling	on	the	ground,	and	he	quickened	his steps	to	a	run.	His	boots	were	rubber-soled,	and	all	but	noiseless.	"Here,	I	say,"

he	said	as	he	came	up.	"Let	that	man	alone.	What	are	you	doing?"	he	added	in halting	French.	One	of	the	two	girls	gave	a	little	scream,	but	the	other straightened	herself,	and	Peter	perceived	that	he	knew	her.	It	was	Louise,	of Travalini's.

"What	are	you	doing?"	he	demanded	again	in	English.	"Is	he	hurt?"

"Non,	non,	monsieur,"	said	Louise.	"He	is	but	'zig-zag.'	We	found	him	a	little way	down	the	street,	and	he	cannot	walk	easily.	So	we	help	him.	If	the	gendarme

—how	do	you	call	him?—the	red-cap,	see	him,	maybe	he	will	get	into	trouble.

But	now	you	come.	You	will	doubtless	help	him.	Vraiment,	he	is	in	luck.	We	go now,	monsieur."

Peter	bent	over	the	fallen	man.	He	did	not	know	him,	but	saw	he	was	a	subaltern, though	a	middle-aged	man.	The	fellow	was	very	drunk,	and	did	little	else	than stutter	curses	in	which	the	name	of	our	Lord	was	frequent.

Peter	pulled	at	his	arm,	and	Louise	stooped	to	help	him.	Once	up,	he	got	his	arm round	him,	and	demanded	where	he	lived.

The	man	stared	at	them	foolishly.	Peter	gave	him	a	bit	of	a	shake,	and	demanded the	address	again,	"Come	on,"	he	said.	"Pull	yourself	together,	for	the	Lord's sake.	We	shall	end	before	the	A.P.M.	if	you	don't.	What's	your	camp,	you	fool?"

At	that	the	man	told	him,	stammeringly,	and	Peter	sighed	his	relief.	"I	know,"	he said	to	Louise.	"It's	not	far.	I'll	maybe	get	a	taxi	at	the	corner."	She	pushed	him towards	a	doorway:	"Wait	a	minute,"	she	said.	"I	live	here;	it's	all	right.	I	will	get a	fiacre.	I	know	where	to	find	one."

She	darted	away.	It	seemed	long	to	Peter,	but	in	a	few	minutes	a	horn	tooted	and a	cab	came	round	the	corner.	Between	them,	they	got	the	subaltern	in,	and	Peter gave	the	address.	Then	he	pulled	out	his	purse	before	stepping	in	himself, opened	it,	found	a	ten-franc	note,	and	offered	it	to	Louise.

The	girl	of	the	street	and	the	tavern	pushed	it	away.	"La!"	she	exclaimed.	"Vite!

Get	in.	Bon	Dieu!	Should	I	be	paid	for	a	kindness?	Poor	boy!	he	does	not	know what	he	does.	He	will	'ave	a	head—ah!	terrible—in	the	morning.	And	see,	he	has

fought	for	la	patrie."	She	pointed	to	a	gold	wound-stripe	on	his	arm.	"Bon	soir, monsieur."

She	stepped	back	and	spoke	quickly	to	the	driver,	who	was	watching sardonically.	He	nodded.	"Bon	soir,	monsieur,"	she	said	again,	and	disappeared in	the	doorway.





CHAPTER	IX

A	few	weeks	later	the	War	Office—if	it	was	the	War	Office,	but	one	gets	into	the habit	of	attributing	these	things	to	the	War	Office—had	one	of	its	regular spasms.	It	woke	up	suddenly	with	a	touch	of	nightmare,	and	it	got	fearfully	busy for	a	few	weeks	before	going	to	sleep	again.	All	manner	of	innocent	people	were dragged	into	the	vortex	of	its	activities,	and	blameless	lives	were	disturbed	and terrorised.	This	particular	enthusiasm	involved	even	such	placid	and	contented souls	as	the	Chaplain-General,	the	Principal	Chaplain,	their	entire	staffs	and	a great	many	of	their	rank	and	file.	It	created	a	new	department,	acquired	many additional	offices	for	the	B.E.F.,	dragged	from	their	comfortable	billets	a	certain number	of	high-principled	base	officers,	and	then	(by	the	mercy	of	Providence) flickered	out	almost	as	soon	as	the	said	officers	bad	made	themselves	a	little more	comfortable	than	before	in	their	new	posts.

It	was	so	widespread	a	disturbance	that	even	Peter	Graham,	most	harmless	of men,	with	plenty	of	his	own	fish	to	fry,	was	dragged	into	it,	as	some	leaf, floating	placidly	downstream,	may	be	caught	and	whirled	away	in	an	excited eddy.	More	definitely,	it	removed	him	from	Havre	and	Julie	just	when	he	was beginning	to	want	most	definitely	to	stay	there,	and	of	course,	when	it	happened, he	could	hardly	know	that	it	was	to	be	but	a	temporary	separation.

He	was	summoned,	then,	one	fine	morning,	to	his	A.C.G.'s	office	in	town,	and he	departed	on	a	bicycle,	turning	over	in	his	mind	such	indiscretions	of	which	he had	been	guilty	and	wondering	which	of	them	was	about	to	trip	him.	Pennell	had been	confident,	indeed,	and	particular.

"You're	for	it,	old	bean,"	he	had	said.	"There's	a	limit	to	the	patience	even	of	the Church.	They	are	going	to	say	that	there	is	no	need	for	you	to	visit	hospitals	after dark,	and	that	their	padres	mustn't	be	seen	out	with	nurses	who	smoke	in	public.

And	all	power	to	their	elbow,	I	say."

Peter's	reply	was	certainly	not	in	the	Prayer-Book,	and	would	probably	have scandalised	its	compilers,	but	he	thought,	secretly,	that	there	might	be	something in	what	his	friend	said.	Consequently	he	rode	his	bicycle	carelessly,	and	was indifferent	to	tram-lines	and	some	six	inches	of	nice	sticky	mud	on	parts	of	the pavé.	In	the	ordinary	course,	therefore,	these	things	revenged	themselves	upon him.	He	came	off	neatly	and	conveniently	opposite	a	small	 café	debit	at	a	turn	in the	dock	road,	and	the	mud	prevented	the	 pavé	from	seriously	hurting	him.

A	Frenchman,	minding	the	cross-lines,	picked	him	up,	and	he,	madame,	her assistant,	and	a	customer,	carried	him	into	the	kitchen	off	the	bar	and	washed	and dried	him.	The	least	he	could	do	was	a	glass	of	French	beer	all	round,	with	a franc	to	the	dock	labourer	who	straightened	his	handle-bars	and	tucked	in	a	loose spoke,	and	for	all	this	the	War	Office—if	it	was	the	War	Office,	for	it	may,	quite possibly,	have	been	Lord	Northcliffe	or	Mr.	Bottomley,	or	some	other	controller of	our	national	life—was	directly	responsible.	When	one	thinks	that	in	a	hundred places	just	such	disturbances	were	in	progress	in	ten	times	as	many	innocent lives,	one	is	appalled	at	their	effrontery.	They	ought	to	eat	and	drink	more carefully,	or	take	liver	pills.

However,	in	due	time	Peter	sailed	up	to	the	office	of	his	immediate	chief	but little	the	worse	for	wear,	and	was	ushered	in.	He	was	prepared	for	a	solitary interview,	but	he	found	a	council	of	some	two	dozen	persons,	who	included	an itinerant	Bishop,	an	Oxford	Professor,	a	few	Y.M.C.A.	ladies,	and—triumph	of the	A.C.G.—a	Labour	member.	Peter	could	not	conceive	that	so	great	a	weight of	intellect	could	be	involved	in	his	affairs,	and	took	comfort.	He	seated	himself on	a	wooden	chair,	and	put	on	his	most	intelligent	appearance;	and	if	it	was slightly	marred	by	a	mud	streak	at	the	back	of	his	ear,	overlooked	by	madame's kindly	assistant	who	had	attended	to	that	side	of	him,	he	was	not	really	to	blame.

Again,	it	was	the	fault	of	Lord	Northcliffe	or—or	any	of	the	rest	of	them.

It	transpired	that	he	was	slightly	late:	the	Bishop	had	been	speaking.	He	was	a good	Bishop	and	eloquent,	and,	as	the	A.C.G.	who	now	rose	to	take	the	matter	in hand	remarked,	he	had	struck	the	right	note.	In	all	probability	it	was	due	to Peter's	having	missed	that	note	that	he	was	so	critical	of	the	scheme.	The	note would	have	toned	him	up.	He	would	have	felt	a	more	generous	sympathy	for	the lads	in	the	field,	and	would	have	been	more	definitely	convinced	that	something must	be	done.	If	not	plainly	stated	in	the	Holy	Scriptures,	his	lordship	had	at least	found	it	indicated	there,	but	Peter	was	not	aware	of	this.	He	only	observed that	the	note	had	made	everyone	solemn	and	intense	except	the	Labour	member.

That	gentleman,	indeed,	interrupted	the	A.C.G.	before	he	was	fairly	on	his	legs with	the	remark:	"Beggin'	your	pardon,	sir,	but	as	this	is	an	informal	conference, does	anyone	mind	if	I	smoke?"…

Peter's	A.C.G.	was	anything	but	a	fool,	and	the	nightmare	from	Headquarters had	genuinely	communicated	itself	to	him.	He	felt	all	he	said,	and	he	said	it	ably.

He	lacked	only	in	one	regard:	he	had	never	been	down	among	the	multitude.	He knew	exactly	what	would	have	to	have	been	in	his	own	mind	for	him	to	act	as	he believed	some	of	them	were	acting,	and	he	knew	exactly	how	he	would,	in	so deplorable	a	condition	of	affairs,	have	set	about	remedying	it.	These	things,	then, he	stated	boldly	and	clearly.	As	he	proceeded,	the	Y.M.C.A.	ladies	got	out notebooks,	the	Professor	allowed	himself	occasional	applause,	and	the	Labour member	lit	another	pipe.

It	appeared	that	there	was	extreme	unrest	and	agitation	among	the	troops,	or	at least	a	section	of	the	troops,	for	no	one	could	say	that	the	armies	in	the	field	were not	magnificent.	They	had	got	to	remember	that	the	Tommy	of	to-day	was	not	as the	Tommy	of	yesterday—not	that	he	suffered	by	comparison,	but	that	he	was far	better	educated	and	far	more	inclined	to	think	for	himself.	They	were	well aware	that	a	little	knowledge	was	a	dangerous	thing,	or,	again,	as	his	friend	the Bishop	would	have	doubtless	put	it,	how	great	a	matter	a	little	fire	kindleth.

There	was	no	escaping	it:	foreign	propaganda,	certain	undesirable	books	and papers—books	and	papers,	he	need	hardly	say,	outside	the	control	of	the reputable	Press—and	even	Socialistic	agitators,	were	abroad	in	the	Army.	He	did not	wish	to	say	too	much;	it	was	enough	to	remind	them	of	what,	possibly,	they already	knew,	that	certain	depots	on	certain	occasions	had	refused	to	sing	the National	Anthem,	and	were	not	content	with	their	wages.	Insignificant	as	these things	might	be	in	detail,	G.H.Q.	had	felt	there	was	justifiable	cause	for	alarm.

This	meeting	had	gathered	to	consider	plans	for	a	remedy.

Now	he	thanked	God	that	they	were	not	Prussians.	There	must	be	no	attempt	at coercion.	A	war	for	liberty	must	be	won	by	free	people.	One	had,	of	course,	to have	discipline	in	the	Army,	but	theirs	was	to-day	a	citizen	Army.	His	friend who	had	left	his	parliamentary	duties	to	visit	France	might	rest	assured	that	the organizations	represented	there	that	morning	would	not	forget	that.	In	a	word, Tommy	had	a	vote,	and	he	was	entitled	to	it,	and	should	keep	it.	One	day	he should	even	use	it;	and	although	no	one	could	wish	to	change	horses	crossing	a stream,	still,	they	hoped	that	day	would	speedily	come—the	day	of	peace	and victory.

But	meantime,	what	was	to	be	done?	As	the	Bishop	had	rightly	said,	something must	be	done.	Resolute	on	this	point,	H.Q.	had	called	in	the	C.G.	and	the	P.C.

and,	he	believed,	expert	opinion	on	both	sides	the	House	of	Commons;	and	the general	opinion	agreed	upon	was	that	Tommy	should	be	educated	to	vote correctly	when	the	time	came,	and	to	wait	peacefully	for	that	time.	The	Professor could	tell	them	of	schemes	even	now	in	process	of	formation	at	home	in	order that	the	land	they	loved	might	be	cleaner,	sweeter,	better	and	happier,	in	the	days to	come.	But	Tommy,	meantime,	did	not	know	of	these	things.	He	was apparently	under	the	delusion	that	he	must	work	out	his	own	salvation,	whereas, in	point	of	fact,	it	was	being	worked	out	for	him	scientifically	and	religiously.	If these	things	were	clearly	laid	before	him,	H.Q.	was	convinced	that	agitation, dissatisfaction,	and	even	revolution—for	there	were	those	who	thought	they were	actually	trending	in	that	direction—would	be	nipped	in	the	bud.

The	scheme	was	simple	and	far-reaching.	Lectures	would	be	given	all	over	the areas	occupied	by	British	troops.	Every	base	would	be	organised	in	such	a	way that	such	lectures	and	even	detailed	courses	of	study	should	be	available	for everyone.	Every	chaplain,	hutworker,	and	social	entertainer	must	do	his	or	her bit.	They	must	know	how	to	speak	wisely	and	well—not	all	in	public,	but, everyone	as	the	occasion	offered,	privately,	in	hut	or	camp,	to	inquiring	and dissatisfied	Tommies.	They	would	doubtless	feel	themselves	insufficient	for these	things,	but	study-circles	were	to	be	formed	and	literature	obtained	which would	completely	furnish	them	with	information.	He	would	conclude	by	merely laying	on	the	table	a	bundle	of	the	splendid	papers	and	tracts	already	prepared for	this	work.	The	Professor	would	now	outline	what	was	being	attempted	at home,	and	then	the	meeting	would	be	open	for	discussion.

The	Professor	was	given	half	an	hour,	and	he	made	an	excellent	speech	for	a cornered	and	academic	theorist.	The	first	ten	minutes	he	devoted	to	explaining that	he	could	not	explain	in	the	time;	in	the	second,	tempering	the	wind	to	the shorn	lamb,	he	pointed	out	that	it	was	no	use	his	outlining	schemes	not	yet completed,	or	that	they	could	read	for	themselves,	or	that,	possibly,	without some	groundwork,	they	could	not	understand;	and	in	the	third	ten	minutes	he outlined	the	committees	dealing	with	the	work	and	containing	such	well-known names	as	Robert	Smiley,	Mr.	Button,	and	Clydens.	He	sat	down.	Everyone applauded—the	M.P.,	and	possibly	the	A.C.G.,	because	they	honestly	knew	and respected	these	gentlemen,	and	the	rest	because	they	felt	they	ought	to	do	so.

The	meeting	was	then	opened	for	discussion.

Peter	took	no	part	in	what	followed,	and,	indeed,	nothing	over-illuminating	was said	save	one	remark,	cast	upon	the	waters	by	the	Labour	member,	which	was destined	to	be	found	after	many	days.	They	were	talking	of	the	lectures,	and	one of	the	ladies	(Peter	understood	a	Girton	lecturer)	was	apparently	eager	to	begin without	delay.	The	M.P.	begged	to	ask	a	question:	Were	there	to	be	questions	and a	discussion?

The	A.C.G.	glanced	at	a	paper	before	him,	and	rose.	He	apologised	for	omitting to	mention	it	before,	but	H.Q.	thought	it	would	be	subverse	of	all	discipline	if, let	us	say,	privates	should	be	allowed	to	get	up	and	argue	with	the	officers	who might	have	addressed	them.	They	all	knew	what	might	be	said	in	the	heat	of argument.	Also,	if	he	might	venture	to	say	so,	some	of	their	lecturers,	though primed	with	the	right	lecture,	might	not	be	such	experts	that	they	could	answer every	question,	and	plainly	failure	to	satisfy	a	questioner	might	be	disastrous.

But	questions	could	be	written	and	replies	given	at	the	next	lecture.	He	thought, smiling,	that	some	of	them	would	perhaps	find	that	convenient.

The	M.P.	leaned	back	in	his	chair.	"Well,	sir,"	he	said,	"I'm	sorry	to	be	a	wet-blanket,	but	if	that	is	so,	the	scheme	is	wrecked	from	the	start.	You	don't	know the	men;	I	do.	They're	not	going	to	line	up,	like	the	pupils	of	Dotheboys Academy,	for	a	spoonful	of	brimstone	and	treacle."

The	meeting	was	slightly	scandalised.	The	chairman,	however,	rose	to	the occasion.	That,	he	said,	was	a	matter	for	H.Q.	They	were	there	to	do	their	duty.

And,	being	an	able	person,	he	did	his.	In	ten	minutes	they	were	formed	into study-bands	and	were	pledged	to	study,	with	which	conclusion	the	meeting adjourned.

Peter	was	almost	out	of	the	door	when	he	heard	his	name	called,	and	turning, saw	the	A.C.G.	beckoning	him.	He	went	up	to	the	table	and	shook	hands.

"Do	you	know	the	Professor?"	asked	his	superior.	"Professor,	this	is	Mr.

Graham."

"How	do	you	do?"	said	the	man	of	science.	"You	are	Graham	of	Balliol,	aren't you?	You	read	Political	Science	and	Economics	a	little	at	Oxford,	I	think?	You ought	to	be	the	very	man	for	us,	especially	as	you	know	how	to	speak."

Peter	was	confused,	but,	being	human,	a	little	flattered.	He	confessed	to	the	sins enumerated,	and	waited	for	more.

"Well,"	said	the	A.C.G.,	"I've	sent	in	your	name	already,	Graham,	and	they	want you	to	go	to	Abbeville	for	a	few	weeks.	A	gathering	is	to	be	made	there	of	the more	promising	material,	and	you	are	to	get	down	to	the	work	of	making	a syllabus,	and	so	on.	You	will	meet	other	officers	from	all	branches	of	the Service,	and	it	should	be	interesting	and	useful.	I	presume	you	will	be	willing	to go?	Of	course	it	is	entirely	optional,	but	I	may	say	that	the	men	who	volunteer will	not	be	forgotten."

"Quite	so,"	said	the	Professor.	"They	will	render	extremely	valuable	service.	I shall	hope	to	be	there	part	of	the	time	myself."

Peter	thought	quickly	of	a	number	of	things,	as	one	does	at	such	a	moment.

Some	of	them	were	serious	things,	and	some	quite	frivolous—like	Julie.	But	he could	hardly	do	otherwise	than	consent.	He	asked	when	he	should	have	to	go.

"In	a	few	days.	You'll	have	plenty	of	time	to	get	ready.	I	should	advise	you	to write	for	some	books,	and	begin	to	read	up	a	little,	for	I	expect	you	are	a	bit rusty,	like	the	rest	of	us.	And	I	shall	hope	to	have	you	back	lecturing	in	this Army	area	before	long."

So	to	speak,	bowed	out,	Peter	made	his	way	home.	In	the	Rue	de	Paris	Julie passed	him,	sitting	with	a	couple	of	other	nurses	in	an	ambulance	motor-lorry, and	she	waved	her	hand	to	him.	The	incident	served	to	depress	him	still	more, and	he	was	a	bit	petulant	as	he	entered	the	mess.	He	flung	his	cap	on	the	table, and	threw	himself	into	a	chair.

"Well,"	said	Pennell,	who	was	there,	"on	the	peg	all	right?"

"Don't	be	a	fool!"	said	Peter	sarcastically.	"I'm	wanted	on	the	Staff.

Haig	can't	manage	without	me.	I've	got	to	leave	this	perishing	suburb	and skip	up	to	H.Q.,	and	don't	you	forget	it,	old	dear.	I	shall	probably	be	a Major-General	before	you	get	your	third	pip.	Got	that?"

Pennell	took	his	pipe	from	his	mouth.	"What's	in	the	wind	now?"	he	demanded.

"Well,	you	might	not	have	noticed	it,	but	I'm	a	political	and	economic	expert, and	Haig's	fed	up	that	you	boys	don't	tumble	to	the	wisdom	of	the	centuries	as you	ought.	Consequently	I've	got	to	instruct	you.	I'm	going	to	waltz	around	in	a motor-car,	probably	with	tabs	up,	and	lecture.	And	there	aren't	to	be	any questions	asked,	for	that's	subversive	of	discipline."

"Good	Lord,	man,	do	talk	sense!	What	in	the	world	do	you	mean?"

"I	mean	jolly	well	what	I	say,	if	you	want	to	know,	or	something	precious	like	it.

The	blinking	Army's	got	dry-rot	and	revolutionary	fever,	and	we	may	all	be murdered	in	our	little	beds	unless	I	put	a	shoulder	to	the	wheel.	That's	a	bit mixed,	but	it'll	stand.	I	shall	be	churning	out	this	thing	by	the	yard	in	a	little."

"Any	extra	pay?"	demanded	Pennell	anxiously.	"I	can	lecture	on	engineering, and	would	do	for	an	extra	sixpence.	Whisky's	going	up,	and	I	haven't	paid	my last	mess	bill."

"You	haven't,	old	son,"	said	Arnold,	coming	in,	"and	you've	jolly	well	got	to.

Here's	a	letter	for	you,	Graham."

Peter	glanced	at	the	envelope	and	tore	it	open.	Pennell	knocked	his	pipe	out	with feigned	dejection.	"The	fellow	makes	me	sick,	padre,"	he	said.	"He	gets	billets-doux	every	hour	of	the	blessed	day."

Peter	jumped	up	excitedly.	"This	is	better,"	he	said.	"It's	a	letter	from	Langton	at Rouen,	a	chap	I	met	there	who	writes	occasionally.	He's	been	hauled	in	for	this stunt	himself,	and	is	to	go	to	Abbeville	as	well.	By	Jove,	I'll	go	up	with	him	if	I can.	Give	me	some	paper,	somebody.	I'll	have	to	write	to	him	at	once,	or	we'll boss	it."

"And	make	a	will,	and	write	to	a	dozen	girls,	I	should	think,"	said	Pennell.	"I don't	know	what	the	blooming	Army's	coming	to.	Might	as	well	chuck	it	and have	peace,	I	think.	But	meantime	I've	got	to	leave	you	blighted	slackers	to	gad about	the	place,	and	go	and	do	an	honest	day's	work. I	don't	get	Staff	jobs	and red	tabs.	No;	I	help	win	the	ruddy	war,	that's	all.	See	you	before	you	go,	Graham, I	suppose?	They'll	likely	run	the	show	for	a	day	or	two	more	without	you.

There'll	be	time	for	you	to	stand	a	dinner	on	the	strength	of	it	yet."

A	week	later	Peter	met	Langton	by	appointment	in	the	Rouen	club,	the	two	of them	being	booked	to	travel	that	evening	via	Amiens	to	Abbeville.	His	tall	friend was	drinking	a	whisky-and-soda	in	the	smoke-room	and	talking	with	a somewhat	bored	expression	to	no	less	a	person	than	Jenks	of	the	A.S.C.

Peter	greeted	them.	"Hullo!"	he	said	to	the	latter.	"Fancy	meeting	you	here	again.

Don't	say	you're	going	to	lecture	as	well?"

"The	good	God	preserve	us!"	exclaimed	Jenks	blasphemously.	"But	I	am	off	in your	train	to	Boulogne.	Been	transferred	to	our	show	there,	and	between ourselves,	I'm	not	sorry	to	go.	It's	a	decent	hole	in	some	ways,	Boulogne,	and	it's time	I	got	out	of	Rouen.	You're	a	lucky	man,	padre,	not	to	be	led	into	temptation by	every	damned	girl	you	meet.	I	don't	know	what	they	see	in	me,"	he	continued mournfully,	"and,	at	this	hour	of	the	afternoon,	I	don't	know	what	I	see	in	them."

"Nor	do	I,"	said	Langton.	"Have	a	drink,	Graham?	There'll	be	no	getting anything	on	the	ruddy	train.	We	leave	at	six-thirty,	and	get	in	somewhere	about four	a.m.	next	morning,	so	far	as	I	can	make	out."

"You	don't	sound	over-cheerful,"	said	Graham.

"I'm	not.	I'm	fed	up	over	this	damned	lecture	stunt!	The	thing's	condemned	to failure	from	the	start,	and	at	any	rate	it's	no	time	for	it.	Fritz	means	more	by	this push	than	the	idiots	about	here	allow.	He	may	not	get	through;	but,	on	the	other hand,	he	may.	If	he	does,	it's	UP	with	us	all.	And	here	we	are	to	go	lecturing	on economics	and	industrial	problems	while	the	damned	house	is	on	fire!"

Peter	took	his	drink	and	sat	down.	"What's	your	particular	subject?"	he	asked.

"The	Empire.	Colonies.	South	Africa.	Canada.	And	why?	Because	I	took	a degree	in	History	in	Cambridge,	and	have	done	surveying	on	the	C.P.R.	Lor'!

Finish	that	drink	and	have	another."

They	went	together	to	the	station,	and	got	a	first	to	themselves,	in	which	they were	fortunate.	They	spread	their	kit	about	the	place,	suborned	an	official	to warn	everyone	else	off,	and	then	Peter	and	Langton	strolled	up	and	down	the platform	for	half	an	hour,	as	the	train	was	not	now	to	start	till	seven.	Somebody told	them	there	was	a	row	on	up	the	line,	though	it	was	not	plain	how	that	would affect	them.	Jenks	departed	on	business	of	his	own.	A	girl	lived	somewhere	in the	neighbourhood.

"How're	you	getting	on	now,	padre?"	asked	Langton.

"I'm	not	getting	on,"	said	Peter.	"I'm	doing	my	job	as	best	I	can,	and	I'm	seeing all	there	is	to	see,	but	I'm	more	in	a	fog	than	ever.	I've	got	a	hospital	at	Havre, and	I	distribute	cigarettes	and	the	news	of	the	day.	That's	about	all.	I	get	on	all right	with	the	men	socially,	and	now	and	again	I	meet	a	keen	Nonconformist who	wants	me	to	pray	with	him,	or	an	Anglican	who	wants	Holy	Communion,

but	not	many.	When	I	preach	I	rebuke	vice,	as	the	Apostle	says,	but	I'm	hanged if	I	really	know	why."

Langton	laughed.	"That's	a	little	humorous,	padre,"	he	said.	"What	about	the	Ten Commandments?"

Peter	thought	of	Julie.	He	kicked	a	stone	viciously.	"Commandments	are	no	use,"

he	said—"not	out	here."

"Nor	anywhere,"	said	Langton,	"nor	ever,	I	think,	too.	Why	do	you	suppose	I keep	moderately	moral?	Chiefly	because	I	fear	natural	consequences	and	have	a wife	and	kiddies	that	I	love.	Why	does	Jenks	do	the	opposite?	Because	he's	more of	a	fool	or	less	of	a	coward,	and	chiefly	loves	himself.	That's	all,	and	that's	all there	is	in	it	for	most	of	us."

"You	don't	fear	God	at	all,	then?"	demanded	Peter.

"Oh	that	I	knew	where	I	might	find	him!"	quoted	Langton.	"I	don't	believe He	thundered	on	Sinai,	at	any	rate."

"Nor	spoke	in	the	Sermon	on	the	Mount?"

"Ah,	I'm	not	so	sure	but	it	seems	to	me	that	He	said	too	much	or	He	said	too little	there,	Graham.	One	can't	help	'looking	on'	a	woman	occasionally.	And	in any	case	it	doesn't	seem	to	me	that	the	Sermon	is	anything	like	the Commandments.	Brotherly	love	is	behind	the	first,	fear	of	a	tribal	God	behind the	second.	So	far	as	I	can	see,	Christ's	creed	was	to	love	and	to	go	on	loving	and never	to	despair	of	love.	Love,	according	to	Him,	was	stronger	than	hate,	or commandments	or	preaching,	or	the	devil	himself.	If	He	saved	souls	at	all,	He saved	them	by	loving	them	whatever	they	were,	and	I	reckon	He	meant	us	to	do the	same.	What	do	you	make	of	the	woman	taken	in	adultery,	and	the	woman who	wiped	His	feet	with	her	hair?	Or	of	Peter?	or	of	Judas?	He	saved	Peter	by loving	him	when	he	thought	he	ought	to	have	the	Ten	Commandments	and	hell fire	thrown	at	his	head	and	I	reckon	He'd	have	saved	Judas	by	giving	him	that sop-token	of	love	if	he	hadn't	had	a	soul	that	could	love	nothing	but	himself."

"What	is	love,	Langton?"	asked	Peter,	after	a	pause.

The	other	looked	at	him	curiously,	and	laughed.	"Ask	the	Bishops,"	he	said.

"Don't	ask	me.	I	don't	know.	Living	with	the	woman	to	whom	you're	married

because	you	fear	to	leave	her,	or	because	you	get	on	all	right,	is	not	love	at	any rate.	I	can't	see	that	marriage	has	got	much	to	do	with	it.	It's	a	decent	convention of	society	at	this	stage	of	development	perhaps,	and	it	may	sign	and	seal	love	for some	people.	But	I	reckon	love's	love—a	big	positive	thing	that's	bigger	than	sin, and	bigger	than	the	devil.	I	reckon	that	if	God	sees	that	anywhere,	He's	satisfied.

I	don't	think	Cranmer's	marriage	service	affects	Him	much,	nor	the	laws	of	the State.	If	a	man	cares	to	do	without	either,	he	runs	a	risk,	of	course.	Society's	hard on	a	woman,	and	man's	meant	to	be	a	gregarious	creature.	But	that's	all	there	is in	it."

"But	how	can	you	tell	lust	from	love?"	demanded	Peter.

"You	can't,	I	think,"	said	Langton.	"Most	men	can't,	anyway.	Women	may	do, but	I	don't	know.	I	reckon	that	what	they	lust	after	mostly	is	babies	and	a	home.	I don't	think	they	know	it	any	more	than	men	know	that	what	they're	after	is	the gratification	of	a	passion;	but	there	it	is.	We're	sewer	rats	crawling	up	a	damned long	drain,	if	you	ask	me,	padre!	I	don't	know	who	said	it,	but	it's	true."

They	turned	in	their	walk,	and	Peter	looked	out	over	the	old	town.	In	the	glow	of sunset	the	thin	iron	modern	spire	of	the	cathedral	had	a	grace	not	its	own,	and the	roofs	below	it	showed	strong	and	almost	sentient.	One	could	imagine	that	the distant	cathedral	brooding	over	the	city	heard,	saw,	and	spoke,	if	in	another language	than	the	language	of	men.

"If	that	were	all,	Langton,"	said	Peter	suddenly,	"I'd	shoot	myself."

"You're	a	queer	fellow,	Graham,"	said	Langton.	"I	almost	think	you	might.	I'd like	to	know	what	becomes	of	you,	anyway.	Forgive	me—I	don't	mean	to	be rude—but	you	may	make	a	parson	yet.	But	don't	found	a	new	religion	for Heaven's	sake,	and	don't	muddle	up	man-made	laws	and	God-made	instincts—if they	are	God-made,"	he	added.

Peter	said	nothing,	until	they	were	waiting	at	the	carriage-door	for	Jenks.	Then he	said:	"Then	you	think	out	here	men	have	simply	abandoned	conventions,	and because	there	is	no	authority	or	fear	or	faith	left	to	them,	they	do	as	they	please?"

Langton	settled	himself	in	a	corner.	"Yes,"	he	said,	"that's	right	in	a	way.	But that's	negatively.	I'd	go	farther	than	that.	Of	course,	there	are	a	lot	of	Judas Iscariots	about	for	whom	I	shouldn't	imagine	the	devil	himself	has	much	time, though	I	suppose	we	ought	not	to	judge	'em,	but	there	are	also	a	lot	of	fine

fellows—and	fine	women.	They	are	men	and	women,	if	I	understand	it,	who have	sloughed	off	the	conventions,	that	are	conventions	simply	for	convention's sake,	and	who	are	reaching	out	towards	the	realities.	Most	of	them	haven't	an idea	what	those	are,	but	dumbly	they	know.	Tommy	knows,	for	instance,	who	is a	good	chum	and	who	isn't;	that	is,	he	knows	that	sincerity	and	unselfishness	and pluck	are	realities.	He	doesn't	care	a	damn	if	a	chap	drinks	and	swears	and commits	what	the	Statute-Book	and	the	Prayer-Book	call	fornication.	And	he certainly	doesn't	think	there	is	an	ascending	scale	of	sins,	or	at	any	rate	that	you parsons	have	got	the	scale	right."

"I	shouldn't	be	surprised	if	we	haven't,"	said	Peter.	"The	Bible	lumps	liars	and drunkards	and	murderers	and	adulterers	and	dogs—whatever	that	may	mean—

into	hell	altogether."

"That's	so,"	said	Langton,	sticking	a	candle	on	the	window-sill;	"but	I	reckon that's	not	so	much	because	they	lie	or	drink	or	murder	or	lust	or—or	grin	about the	city	like	our	friend	Jenks,	who'll	likely	miss	the	boat	for	that	very	reason,	but because	of	something	else	they	all	have	in	common."

"What's	that?"	demanded	Peter.

"I	haven't	the	faintest	idea,"	said	Langton.

At	this	moment	the	French	guard,	an	R.T.O.,	and	Jenks	appeared	in	sight simultaneously,	the	two	former	urging	the	latter	along.	He	caught	sight	of	them, and	waved.

"Help	him	in,"	said	the	R.T.O.,	a	jovial-looking	subaltern,	genially—"and	keep him	there,"	he	added	under	his	voice.	"He's	had	all	he	can	carry,	and	if	he	gets loose	again	he'll	be	for	the	high	jump.	The	wonder	is	he	ever	got	back	in	time."

Peter	helped	him	up.	The	subaltern	glanced	at	his	badges	and	smiled.	"He's	in good	company	anyway,	padre,"	he	said.	"If	you're	leaving	the	ninety-and-nine	in the	wilderness,	here's	one	to	bring	home	rejoicing."	He	slammed	the	door.

"Right-o!"	he	said	to	the	guard;	"they're	all	aboard	now."	The	man comprehended	the	action,	and	waved	a	flag.	The	train	started	after	the	manner	of French	trains	told	off	for	the	use	of	British	soldiers,	and	Jenks	collapsed	on	the seat.

"Damned	near	thing	that!"	he	said	unsteadily;	"might	have	missed	the	bloody

boat!	I	saw	my	little	bit,	though.	She's	a	jolly	good	sort,	she	is.	Blasted	strong stuff	that	French	brandy,	though!	Whiskies	at	the	club	first,	yer	know.	Give	us	a hand,	padre;	I	reckon	I'll	just	lie	down	a	bit….	Jolly	good	sort	of	padre,	eh, skipper?	What?"

Peter	helped	him	into	his	place,	and	then	came	and	sat	at	his	feet,	opposite Langton,	who	smiled	askance	at	him.	"I'll	read	a	bit,"	he	said.	"Jenks	won't trouble	us	further;	he'll	sleep	it	off.	I	know	his	sort.	Got	a	book,	padre?"

Peter	said	he	had,	but	that	he	wouldn't	read	for	a	little,	and	he	sat	still	looking	at the	country	as	they	jolted	past	in	the	dusk.	After	a	while	Langton	lit	his	candle, and	contrived	a	wind-screen,	for	the	centre	window	was	broken,	of	a	newspaper.

Peter	watched	him	drowsily.	He	had	been	up	early	and	travelled	already	that	day.

The	motion	helped,	too,	and	in	half	an	hour	or	so	he	was	asleep.

He	dreamt	that	he	was	preaching	Langton's	views	on	the	Sermon	on	the	Mount in	the	pulpit	of	St.	John's,	and	that	the	Canon,	from	his	place	beside	the credence-table	within	the	altar-rails,	was	shouting	at	him	to	stop.	In	his	dream	he persisted,	however,	until	that	irate	dignitary	seized	the	famous	and	massive offertory-dish	by	his	side	and	hurled	it	in	the	direction	of	the	pulpit.	The	clatter that	it	made	on	the	stone	floor	awoke	him.

He	was	first	aware	that	the	train	was	no	longer	in	motion,	and	next	that Langton's	tall	form	was	leaning	half	out	of	the	window.	Then	confused	noises penetrated	his	consciousness,	and	he	perceived	that	light	flickered	in	the otherwise	darkened	compartment.	"Where	are	we?"	he	demanded,	now	fully awake.	"What's	up?"

Langton	answered	over	his	shoulder.	"Some	where	outside	of	a	biggish	town,"

he	said;	"and	there's	the	devil	of	a	strafe	on.	The	whole	sky-line's	lit	up,	but	that may	be	twenty	miles	off.	However,	Fritz	must	have	advanced	some."

He	was	interrupted	by	a	series	of	much	louder	explosions	and	the	rattle	of machine-gun	fire.	"That's	near,"	he	said.	"Over	the	town,	I	should	say—an	air-raid,	though	it	may	be	long-distance	firing.	Come	and	see	for	yourself."

He	pulled	himself	back	into	the	carriage,	and	Peter	leaned	out	of	the	window	in his	turn.	It	was	as	the	other	had	said.	Flares	and	sudden	flashes,	that	came	and went	more	like	summer-lightning	than	anything	else,	lit	up	the	whole	sky-line, but	nearer	at	hand	a	steady	glow	from	one	or	two	places	showed	in	the	sky.	One

could	distinguish	flights	of	illuminated	tracer	bullets,	and	now	and	again	what	he took	to	be	Very	lights	exposed	the	countryside.	Peter	saw	that	they	were	in	a siding,	the	banks	of	which	reached	just	above	the	top	of	the	compartments.	It was	only	by	craning	that	he	could	see	fields	and	what	looked	like	a	house beyond.	Men	were	leaning	out	of	all	the	windows,	mostly	in	silence.	In	the compartment	next	them	a	man	cursed	the	Huns	for	spoiling	his	beauty	sleep.	It was	slightly	overdone,	Peter	thought.

"Good	God!"	said,	his	companion	behind	him.	"Listen!"

It	was	difficult,	but	between	the	louder	explosions	Peter	concentrated	his	senses on	listening.	In	a	minute	he	heard	something	new,	a	faint	buzz	in	the	air.

"Aeroplanes,"	said	Langton	coolly.	"I	hope	they	don't	spot	us.	Let	me	see.

Maybe	it's	our	planes."	He	craned	out	in	Peter's	place.	"I	can't	see	anything,"	he said,	"and	you	can	hear	they're	flying	high."

Down	the	train	everyone	was	staring	upwards	now.	"Christ!"	exclaimed	Langton suddenly,	"some	fool's	lighting	a	pipe!	Put	that	match	out	there,"	he	called.

Other	voices	took	him	up.	"That's	better,"	he	said	in	a	minute.	"Forgive	my swearing,	padre,	but	a	match	might	give	us	away."

Peter	was	silent,	and,	truth	to	tell,	terrified.	He	tried	hard	not	to	feel	it,	and glanced	at	Jenks.	He	was	still	asleep,	and	breathing	heavily.	He	pressed	his	face against	the	pane,	and	tried	to	stare	up	too.

"They're	coming,"	said	Langton	suddenly	and	quickly.	"There	they	are,	too—

Hun	planes.	They	may	not	see	us,	of	course,	but	they	may…."	He	brought	his head	in	again	and	sat	down.

"Is	there	anything	we	can	do?"	said	Peter.

"Nothing,"	said	Langton,	"unless	you	like	to	get	under	the	seat.	But	that's	no	real good.	It's	on	the	knees	of	the	gods,	padre,	whatever	gods	there	be."

Just	then	Peter	saw	one.	Sailing	obliquely	towards	them	and	lit	by	the	light	of	a flare,	the	plane	looked	serene	and	beautiful.	He	watched	it,	fascinated.

"It's	very	low—two	hundred	feet,	I	should	say,"	said	Langton	behind	him.	"Hope

he's	no	pills	left.	I	wonder	whether	there's	another.	Let's	have	a	look	the	other side."

He	had	scarcely	got	up	to	cross	the	compartment	when	the	rattle	of	a	machine-gun	very	near	broke	out.	"Our	fellows,	likely,"	he	exclaimed	excitedly, struggling	with	the	sash,	but	they	knew	the	truth	almost	as	he	spoke.

Langton	ducked	back.	A	plane	on	the	other	side	was	deliberately	flying	up	the train,	machine-gunning.	"Down,	padre,	for	God's	sake!"	he	exclaimed,	and	threw himself	on	the	floor.

Peter	couldn't	move.	He	heard	the	splintering	of	glass	and	a	rending	of woodwork,	some	oaths,	and	a	sudden	cry.	The	whirr	of	an	engine	filled	his	ears and	seemed,	as	it	were,	on	top	of	them.	Then	there	was	a	crash	all	but	at	his	side, and	next	instant	a	half-smothered	groan	and	a	dreadful	gasp	for	breath.

He	couldn't	speak.	He	heard	Langton	say,	"Hit,	anyone?"	and	then	Jenks'

"They've	got	me,	skipper,"	in	a	muffled	whisper,	and	he	noticed	that	the	hard breathing	had	ceased.	At	that	he	found	strength	and	voice	and	jumped	up.	He bent	over	Jenks.	"Where	have	you	got	it,	old	man?"	he	said,	and	hardly	realised that	it	was	himself	speaking.

The	other	was	lying	just	as	before,	on	his	back,	but	he	had	pulled	his	knees	up convulsively	and	a	rug	had	slipped	off.	In	a	flare	Peter	saw	beads	of	sweat	on	his forehead	and	a	white,	twisted	face.

He	choked	back	panic	and	knelt	down.	He	had	imagined	it	all	before,	and	yet	not quite	like	this.	He	knew	what	he	ought	to	say,	but	for	a	minute	he	could	not formulate	it.	"Where	are	you	hit,	Jenks?"	was	all	he	said.

The	other	turned	his	head	a	little	and	looked	at	him.	"Body—lungs,	I	think,"	he whispered.	"I'm	done,	padre;	I've	seen	chaps	before."

The	words	trailed	off.	Peter	gripped	himself	mentally,	and	steadied	his	voice.

"Jenks,	old	man,"	he	said.	"Just	a	minute.	Think	about	God—you	are	going	to Him,	you	know.	Trust	Him,	will	you?	'The	blood	of	Jesus	Christ,	God's	Son, saveth	us	from	all	sin.'"

The	dying	man,	moved	his	hand	convulsively.	"Don't	you	worry,	padre,"	he	said faintly;	"I've	been—confirmed."	The	lips	tightened	a	second	with	pain,	and	then:

"Reckon	I	won't—shirk.	Have	you—got—a	cigarette?"

Peter	felt	quickly	for	his	case,	fumbled	and	dropped	one,	then	got	another	into his	fingers.	He	hesitated	a	second,	and	then,	put	it	to	his	own	lips,	struck	a match,	and	puffed	at	it.	He	was	in	the	act	of	holding	it	to	the	other	when	Langton spoke	behind	him:

"It's	no	good	now,	padre,"	he	said	quietly;	"it's	all	over."

And	Peter	saw	that	it	was.

The	planes	did	not	come	back.	The	officer	in	charge	of	the	train	came	down	it with	a	lantern,	and	looked	in.	"That	makes	three,"	he	said.	"We	can	do	nothing now,	but	we'll	be	in	the	station	in	a	bit.	Don't	show	any	lights;	they	may	come back.	Where	the	hell	were	our	machines,	I'd	like	to	know?"

He	went	on,	and	Peter	sat	down	in	his	corner.	Langton	picked	up	the	rug,	and covered	up	the	body.	Then	he	glanced	at	Peter.	"Here,"	he	said,	holding	out	a flask,	"have	some	of	this."

Peter	shook	his	head.	Langton	came	over	to	him.	"You	must,"	he	said;	"it'll	pull you	together.	Don't	go	under	now,	Graham.	You	kept	your	nerve	just	now—

come	on."

At	that	Peter	took	it,	and	drained	the	little	cup	the	other	poured	out	for	him.	Then he	handed	it	back,	without	a	word.

"Feel	better?"	queried	the	other,	a	trifle	curiously,	staring	at	him.

"Yes,	thanks,"	said	Peter—"a	damned	sight	better!	Poor	old	Jenks!	What	blasted luck	that	he	should	have	got	it!…	Langton,	I	wish	to	God	it	had	been	me!"

CHAPTER	I

The	charm	of	the	little	towns	of	Northern	France	is	very	difficult	to	imprison	on paper.	It	is	not	exactly	that	they	are	old,	although	there	is	scarcely	one	which	has not	a	church	or	a	château	or	a	quaint	medieval	street	worth	coming	far	to	see;	nor that	they	are	particularly	picturesque,	for	the	ground	is	fairly	flat,	and	they	are	all but	always	set	among	the	fields,	since	it	is	by	agriculture	far	more	than	by manufacture	that	they	live.	But	they	are	clean	and	cheerful;	one	thinks	of	them under	the	sun;	and	they	are	very	homely.	In	them	the	folk	smile	simply	at	you, but	not	inquisitively	as	in	England,	for	each	bustles	gaily	about	his	own	affairs, and	will	let	you	do	what	you	please,	with	a	shrug	of	the	shoulders.	Abbeville	is very	typical	of	all	this.	It	has	its	church,	and	from	the	bridge	over	the	Somme	the backs	of	ancient	houses	can	be	seen	leaning	half	over	the	river,	which	has	sung beneath	them	for	five	hundred	years;	and	it	is	set	in	the	midst	of	memories	of stirring	days.	Yet	it	is	not	for	these	that	one	would	revisit	the	little	town,	but rather	that	one	might	walk	by	the	still	canal	under	the	high	trees	in	spring,	or loiter	in	the	market-place	round	what	the	Hun	has	left	of	the	statue	of	the	famous Admiral	with	his	attendant	nymphs,	or	wander	down	the	winding	streets	that skirt	the	ancient	church	and	give	glimpses	of	its	unfinished	tower.

Peter	found	it	very	good	to	be	there	in	the	days	that	followed	the	death	of	Jenks.

True,	it	was	now	nearer	to	the	seat	of	war	than	it	had	been	for	years,	and	air-raids began	to	be	common,	but	in	a	sense	the	sound	of	the	guns	fitted	in	with	his mood.	So	great	a	battle	was	being	fought	within	him	that	the	world	could	not	in any	case	have	seemed	wholly	at	peace,	and	yet	in	the	quiet	fields,	or	sauntering of	an	afternoon	by	the	river,	he	found	it	easier	than	at	Havre	to	think.	Langton was	almost	his	sole	companion,	and	a	considerable	intimacy	had	grown	up between	them.	Peter	found	that	his	friend	seemed	to	understand	a	great	deal	of his	thoughts	without	explanation.	He	neither	condoled	nor	exhorted;	rather	he watched	with	an	almost	shy	interest	the	other's	inward	battle.

They	lodged	at	the	Hôtel	de	l'Angleterre,	that	hostelry	in	the	street	that	leads	up

and	out	of	the	town	towards	Saint	Riquier,	which	you	enter	from	a	courtyard	that opens	on	the	road	and	has	rooms	that	you	reach	by	means	of	narrow,	rickety flights	of	stairs	and	balconies	overhanging	the	court.	The	big	dining-room	wore an	air	of	gloomy	festivity.	Its	chandeliers	swathed	in	brown	paper,	its	faded paint,	and	its	covered	upholstery,	suggested	that	it	awaited	a	day	yet	to	be	when it	should	blossom	forth	once	more	in	glory	as	in	the	days	of	old.	Till	then	it	was as	merry	as	it	could	be.	Its	little	tables	filled	up	of	an	evening	with	the	new cosmopolitan	population	of	the	town,	and	old	Jacques	bustled	round	with	the good	wine,	and	dropped	no	hint	that	the	choice	brands	were	nearly	at	an	end	in the	cellar.

Peter	and	Langton	would	have	their	war-time	apology	for	 petit	déjeuner	in	bed or	alone.	Peter,	as	a	rule,	was	up	early,	and	used	to	wander	out	a	little	and sometimes	into	church,	coming	back	to	coffee	as	good	as	ever,	but	war-time bread	instead	of	rolls	on	a	small	table	under	a	low	balcony	in	the	courtyard	if	it were	fine.	He	would	linger	over	it,	and	have	chance	conversation	with	passing strangers	of	all	sorts,	from	clerical	personages	belonging	to	the	Church	Army	or the	Y.M.C.A.	to	officers	who	came	and	went	usually	on	unrevealed	affairs.	Then Langton	would	come	down,	and	they	would	stroll	round	to	the	newly-fitted-up office	which	had	been	prepared	for	the	lecture	campaign	and	glance	at	maps	of districts,	and	exchange	news	with	the	officer	in	charge,	who,	having	done	all	he could,	had	now	nothing	to	do	but	stand	by	and	wait	for	the	next	move	from	a War	Office	that	had	either	forgotten	his	existence	or	discovered	some	hitch	in	its plans.	They	had	a	couple	of	lectures	from	people	who	were	alleged	to	know	all about	such	topics	as	the	food	shortage	at	home	or	the	new	plans	for	housing,	but who	invariably	turned	out	to	be	waiting	themselves	for	the	precise	information that	was	necessary	for	successful	lectures.	After	such	they	would	stroll	out through	the	town	into	the	fields,	and	Langton	would	criticise	the	thing	in	lurid but	humorous	language,	and	they	would	come	back	to	the	club	and	sit	or	read	till lunch.

The	club	was	one	of	the	best	in	France,	it	was	an	old	house	with	lovely	furniture, and	not	too	much	of	it,	which	stood	well	back	from	the	street	and	boasted	an	old-fashioned	garden	of	shady	trees	and	spring	flowers	and	green	lawns.	Peter	could both	read	and	write	in	its	rooms,	and	it	was	there	that	he	finally	wrote	to	Hilda, but	not	until	after	much	thought.

After	his	day	with	Julie	at	Caudebec	one	might	have	supposed	that	there	was nothing	left	for	him	to	do	but	break	off	his	engagement	to	Hilda.	But	it	did	not

strike	him	so.	For	one	thing,	he	was	not	engaged	to	Julie	or	anything	like	it,	and he	could	not	imagine	such	a	situation,	even	if	Julie	had	not	positively	repudiated any	desire	to	be	either	engaged	or	married.	He	had	certainly	declared,	in	a	fit	of enthusiasm,	that	he	loved	her,	but	he	had	not	asked	if	she	loved	him.	He	had	seen her	since,	but	although	they	were	very	good	friends,	nothing	more	exciting	had passed	between	them.	Peter	was	conscious	that	when	he	was	with	Julie	she fascinated	him,	but	that	when	he	was	away—ah!	that	was	it,	when	he	was	away?

It	certainly	was	not	that	Hilda	came	back	and	took	her	place;	it	was	rather	that the	other	things	in	his	mind	dominated	him.	It	was	a	curious	state	of	affairs.	He was	less	like	an	orthodox	parson	than	he	had	ever	been,	and	yet	he	had	never thought	so	much	about	religion.	He	agonised	over	it	now.	At	times	his	thoughts were	almost	more	than	he	could	bear.

It	came,	then,	to	this,	that	he	had	not	so	much	changed	towards	Hilda	as	changed towards	life.	Whether	he	had	really	fundamentally	changed	in	such	a	way	that	a break	with	the	old	was	inevitable	he	did	not	know.	Till	then	Hilda	was	part	of	the old,	and	if	he	went	back	to	it	she	naturally	took	her	old	place	in	it.	If	he	did	not

—well,	there	he	invariably	came	to	the	end	of	thought.	Curiously	enough,	it	was when	faced	with	a	mental	blank	that	Julie's	image	began	to	rise	in	his	mind.	If	he admitted	her,	he	found	himself	abandoning	himself	to	her.	He	felt	sometimes	that if	he	could	but	take	her	in	his	arms	he	could	let	the	world	go	by,	and	God	with	it.

Her	kisses	were	at	least	a	reality.	There	was	neither	convention	nor	subterfuge nor	divided	allegiance	there.	She	was	passion,	naked	and	unashamed,	and	at least	real.

And	then	he	would	remember	that	much	of	this	was	problematical	after	all,	for they	had	never	kissed	as	that	passion	demanded,	or	at	least	that	he	had	never	so kissed	her.	He	was	not	sure	of	the	first.	He	knew	that	he	did	not	understand	Julie, but	he	felt,	if	he	did	kiss	her,	it	would	be	a	kiss	of	surrender,	of	finality.	He feared	to	look	beyond	that,	and	he	could	not	if	he	would.

He	wrote,	then,	to	Hilda,	and	he	told	of	the	death	of	Jenks,	and	of	their	arrival	in Abbeville,	"You	must	understand,	dear,"	he	said,	"that	all	this	has	had	a tremendous	effect	upon	me.	In	that	train	all	that	I	had	begun	to	feel	about	the uselessness	of	my	old	religion	came	to	a	head.	I	could	do	no	more	for	that	soul than	light	a	cigarette….	Possibly	no	one	could	have	done	any	more,	but	I	cannot, I	will	not	believe	it.	Jenks	was	not	fundamentally	evil,	or	at	least	I	don't	think	so.

He	was	rather	a	selfish	fool	who	had	no	control,	that	is	all.	He	did	not	serve	the devil;	it	was	much	more	that	he	had	never	seen	any	master	to	serve.	And	I	could

do	nothing.	I	had	no	master	to	show	him.

"You	may	say	that	that	is	absurd:	that	Christ	is	my	Master,	and	I	could	have shown	Him.	Hilda,	so	He	is:	I	cling	passionately	to	that.	But	listen:	I	can't express	Him,	I	don't	understand	Him.	I	no	longer	feel	that	He	was	animating	and ordering	the	form	of	religion	I	administered.	It	is	not	that	I	feel	Anglicanism	to be	untrue,	and	something	else—say	Wesleyanism—to	be	true;	it	is	much	more that	I	feel	them	all	to	be	out	of	touch	with	reality. That's	it.	I	don't	think	you	can possibly	see	it,	but	that	is	the	main	trouble.

"That,	too,	brings	me	to	my	next	point,	and	this	I	find	harder	still	to	express.	I want	you	to	realise	that	I	feel	as	if	I	had	never	seen	life	before.	I	feel	as	if	I	had been	shown	all	my	days	a	certain	number	of	pictures	and	told	that	they	were	the real	thing,	or	given	certain	descriptions	and	told	that	they	were	true.	I	had	always accepted	that	they	were.	But,	Hilda,	they	are	not.	Wickedness	is	not	wicked	in the	way	that	I	was	told	it	was	wicked,	and	what	I	was	told	was	salvation	is	not the	salvation	men	and	women	want.	I	have	been	playing	in	a	fool's	paradise	all these	years,	and	I've	got	outside	the	gate.	I	am	distressed	and	terrified,	I	think, but	underneath	it	all	I	am	very	glad….

"You	will	say,	'What	are	you	going	to	do?'	and	I	can	only	reply,	I	don't	know.	I'm not	going	to	make	any	vast	change,	if	you	mean	that.	A	padre	I	am,	and	a	padre	I shall	stay	for	the	war	at	least,	and	none	of	us	can	see	beyond	that	at	present.	But what	I	do	mean	to	do	is	just	this:	I	mean	to	try	and	get	down	to	reality	myself and	try	to	weigh	it	up.	I	am	going	to	eat	and	drink	with	publicans	and	sinners; maybe	I	shall	find	my	Master	still	there."

Peter	stopped	and	looked	up.	Langton	was	stretched	out	in	a	chair	beside	him, reading	a	novel,	a	pipe	in	his	mouth.	Moved	by	an	impulse,	he	interrupted	him.

"Old	man,"	he	said,	"I	want	you	to	let	me	read	you	a	bit	of	this	letter.

It's	to	my	girl,	but	there's	nothing	rotten	in	reading	it.	May	I?"

Langton	did	not	move.	"Carry	on,"	he	said	shortly.

Peter	finished	and	put	down	the	sheet.	The	other	smoked	placidly	and	said nothing.	"Well?"	demanded	Peter	impatiently.

"I	should	cut	out	that	last	sentence,"	pronounced	the	judge.

"Why?	It's	true."

"Maybe,	but	it	isn't	pretty."

"Langton,"	burst	out	Peter,	"I'm	sick	of	prettinesses!	I've	been	stuffed	up	with them	all	my	life,	and	so	has	she.	I	want	to	break	with	them."

"Very	likely,	and	I	don't	say	that	it	won't	be	the	best	thing	for	you	to	try	for	a little	to	do	so,	but	she	hasn't	been	where	you've	been	or	seen	what	you've	seen.

You	can't	expect	her	wholly	to	understand.	And	more	than	that,	maybe	she	is meant	for	prettinesses.	After	all,	they're	pretty."

Peter	stabbed	the	blotting-paper	with	his	pen.	"Then	she	isn't	meant	for	me,"	he said.

"I'm	not	so	sure,"	said	Langton.	"I	don't	know	that	you've	stuff	enough	in	you	to get	on	without	those	same	prettinesses	yourself.	Most	of	us	haven't.	And	at	any rate	I	wouldn't	burn	my	boats	yet	awhile.	You	may	want	to	escape	yet."

Peter	considered	this	in	silence.	Then	he	drew	the	sheets	to	him	and	added	a	few more	words,	folded	the	paper,	put	it	in	the	envelope,	and	stuck	it	down.	"Come on,"	he	said,	"let's	go	and	post	this	and	have	a	walk."

Langton	got	up	and	looked	at	him	curiously,	as	he	sometimes	did.	"Peter,"	he said,	"you're	a	weird	blighter,	but	there's	something	damned	gritty	in	you.	You take	life	too	strenuously.	Why	can't	you	saunter	through	it	like	I	do?"

Peter	reached	for	this	cap.	"Come	on,"	he	said	again,	"and	don't	talk	rot."

Out	in	the	street,	they	strolled	aimlessly	on,	more	or	less	in	silence.	The	big book-shop	at	the	corner	detained	them	for	a	little,	and	they	regarded	its variegated	contents	through	the	glass.	It	contained	a	few	good	prints,	and	many more	poorly	executed	coloured	pictures	of	ruined	places	in	France	and	Belgium, of	which	a	few,	however,	were	not	bad.	Cheek	by	jowl	with	some	religious works,	a	statue	of	Notre	Dame	d'Albert,	and	some	more	of	Jeanne	d'Arc,	were	a line	of	pornographic	novels	and	beyond	packets	of	picture	post-cards	entitled Théâtreuses,	Le	Bain	de	la	Parisienne,	Les	Seins	des	Marbre,	and	so	on.	Then Langton	drew	Graham's	attention	to	one	or	two	other	books,	one	of	which	had	a gaudy	cover	representing	a	mistress	with	a	birch-rod	in	her	hands	and	a	number of	canes	hung	up	beside	her,	while	a	girl	of	fifteen	or	so,	with	very	red	cheeks,

was	apparently	about	to	be	whipped.	"Good	Lord,"	said	Langton,	"the	French	are beyond	me.	This	window	is	a	study	for	you,	Graham,	in	itself.	I	should	take	it that	it	means	that	there	is	nothing	real	in	life.	It	is	utterly	cynical.

"'And	if	the	Wine	you	drink,	the	Lip	you	press,

End	in	what	All	begins	and	ends	in—Yes;

Think	then	you	are	To-day	what	Yesterday

You	were—To-morrow	you	shall	not	be	less,'"

he	quoted.

"Yes,"	said	Peter.	"Or	else	it	means	that	there	are	only	two	realities,	and	that	the excellent	person	who	keeps	this	establishment	regards	both	in	a	detached	way, and	conceives	it	her	business	to	cater	for	each.	Let's	go	on."

They	turned	the	corner,	and	presently	found	themselves	outside	the	famous carven	door	of	the	church.	"Have	you	ever	been	round?"	asked	Peter.

"No,"	said	Langton;	"let's	go	in."

They	passed	through	the	door	into	the	old	church,	which,	in	contrast	to	that	at	Le Havre,	was	bathed	in	the	daylight	that	streamed	through	many	clear	windows.

Together	they	wandered	round	it,	saying	little.	They	inspected	an	eighteenth-century	statue	of	St.	Roch,	who	was	pulling	up	his	robe	to	expose	a	wound	and looking	upwards	at	the	same	time	seraphically—or,	at	least,	after	the	manner	that the	artist	of	that	age	had	regarded	as	seraphic.	A	number	of	white	ribbons	and some	wax	figures	of	feet	and	hands	and	other	parts	of	the	body	were	tied	to	him.

They	stood	before	a	wonderful	coloured	alabaster	reredos	of	the	fourteenth century,	in	which	shepherds	and	kings	and	beasts	came	to	worship	at	the	manger.

They	had	a	little	conversation	as	to	the	architectural	periods	of	the	nave,	choir, and	transepts,	and	Langton	was	enthusiastic	over	a	noble	pillar	and	arch.	Beyond they	gazed	in	silence	at	a	statue	of	Our	Lady	Immaculate	in	modern	coloured plaster,	so	arranged	that	the	daylight	fell	through	an	unseen	opening	upon	her.

Among	the	objects	in	front	were	a	pair	of	Renaissance	candlesticks	of	great beauty.	A	French	officer	came	up	and	arranged	and	lit	a	votive	candle	as	they watched,	and	then	went	back	to	stand	in	silence	by	a	pillar.	The	church	door banged	and	two	peasants	came	in,	one	obviously	from	the	market,	with	a	huge basket	of	carrots	and	cabbages	and	some	long,	thin	French	loaves.	She	deposited this	just	inside	the	door,	took	holy	water,	clattered	up	towards	the	high	altar,

dropped	a	curtsy,	and	made	her	way	to	an	altar	of	the	Sacred	Heart,	at	which	she knelt.	Peter	sighed.	"Come	on,"	he	said;	"let's	get	out."

Langton	marched	on	before	him,	and	held	the	door	back	as	they	stepped	into	the street.	"Well,	philosopher,"	he	demanded,	"what	do	you	make	of	that?"

Peter	smiled.	"What	do	you?"	he	said.

"Well,"	said	Langton,	"it	leaves	me	unmoved,	except	when	I'm	annoyed	by	the way	their	wretched	images	spoil	the	church,	but	it	is	plain	that	they	like	it.	I should	say	one	of	your	two	realities	is	there.	But	I	find	it	hard	to	forgive	the	bad art."

"Do	you?"	said	Peter,	"I	don't.	It	reminds	me	of	those	appalling	enlargements	of family	groups	that	you	see,	for	example,	in	any	Yorkshire	cottage.	They	are unutterably	hideous,	but	they	stand	for	a	real	thing	that	is	honest	and	beautiful—

the	love	of	home	and	family.	And	by	the	same	token,	when	the	photographs	got exchanged,	as	they	do	in	Mayfair,	for	modern	French	pictures	of	nude	women,	or some	incredible	Futurist	extravagance,	that	love	has	usually	flown	out	of	the window."

"Humph!"	said	Langton—"not	always.	Besides,	why	can't	a	family	group	be made	artistically,	and	so	keep	both	art	and	love?	I	should	think	we	ought	to	aim at	that."

"I	suppose	we	ought,"	said	Peter,	"but	in	our	age	the	two	don't	seem	to	go together.	Goodness	alone	knows	why.	Why,	hullo!"	he	broke	off.

"What's	up	now?"	demanded	Langton.

"Why,	there,	across	the	street,	if	that	isn't	a	nurse	I	know	from	Havre, I	don't	know	who	it	is.	Wait	a	tick."

He	crossed	the	road,	and	saw,	as	he	got	near,	that	it	was	indeed	Julie.	He	came up	behind	her	as	she	examined	a	shop-window.	"By	all	that's	wonderful,	what are	you	doing	here?"	he	asked.

She	turned	quickly,	her	eyes	dancing.	"I	wondered	if	I	should	meet	you,"	she said.	"You	see,	your	letter	told	me	you	were	coming	here,	but	I	haven't	heard from	you	since	you	came,	and	I	didn't	know	if	you	had	started	your	tour	or	not. I

came	simply	enough.	There's	a	big	South	African	hospital	here,	and	we	had	to send	up	a	batch	of	men	by	motor.	As	they	knew	I	was	from	South	Africa,	they gave	me	the	chance	to	come	with	them."

"Well,	I	 am	glad,"	said	Peter,	devouring	the	sight	of	her.	"Wait	a	minute;	I	must introduce	you	to	Langton.	He	and	I	are	together,	and	he's	a	jolly	good	chap."

He	turned	and	beckoned	Langton,	who	came	over	and	was	introduced.	They walked	up	the	street	a	little	way	together.	"Where	are	you	going	now?"	asked Peter.

"Back	to	the	hospital,"	said	Julie.	"A	car	starts	from	the	square	at	twelve-forty-five,	and	I	have	to	be	in	for	lunch."

"Have	you	much	to	do	up	there?"	asked	Peter.

"Oh	no,"	she	said,	"my	job's	done.	I	clear	off	the	day	after	to-morrow.	We	only got	in	last	night,	so	I	get	a	couple	of	days'	holiday.	What	are	you	doing?	You don't	look	any	too	busy."

Peter	glanced	across	at	Langton	and	laughed.	"We	aren't,"	he	said.	"The	whole stunt's	a	wash-out,	if	you	ask	me,	and	we're	really	expecting	to	be	sent	back	any day.	There's	too	much	doing	now	for	lectures.	Is	the	hospital	full?"

"Packed,"	said	Julie	gravely.	"The	papers	say	we're	falling	back	steadily	so	as not	to	lose	men,	but	the	facts	don't	bear	it	out.	We're	crammed	out.	It's	ghastly; I've	never	known	it	so	bad."

Peter	had	hardly	ever	seen	her	grave	before,	and	her	face	showed	a	new	aspect	of her.	He	felt	a	glow	of	warmth	steal	over	him.	"I	say,"	he	said,	"couldn't	you	dine with	us	to-night?	We're	at	the	Angleterre,	and	its	tremendously	respectable."

She	laughed,	her	gravity	vanishing	in	a	minute.	"I	must	say,"	she	said,	"that	I'd love	to	see	you	anywhere	really	respectable.	He's	a	terrible	person	for	a	padre—

don't	you	think	so,	Captain	Langton?"

"Terrible,"	said	Langton.	"But	really	the	Angleterre	is	quite	proper.	You	don't	get any	too	bad	a	dinner,	either.	Do	come,	Miss	Gamelyn."

She	appeared	to	consider.	"I	might	manage	it,"	she	said	at	last,	stopping	just

short	of	entering	the	square;	"but	I	haven't	the	nerve	to	burst	in	and	ask	for	you.

Nor	will	it	do	for	you	to	see	me	all	the	way	to	that	car,	or	we	shall	have	a	dozen girls	talking.	If	you	will	meet	me	somewhere,"	she	added,	looking	at	Peter,	"I'll risk	it.	I'll	have	a	headache	and	not	go	to	first	dinner;	then	the	first	will	think	I'm at	the	second,	and	the	second	at	the	first.	Besides,	I've	no	duty,	and	the	hospital's not	like	Havre.	It's	all	spread	out	in	huts	and	tents,	and	it's	easy	enough	to	get	in.

Last,	but	not	least,	it's	Colonial,	and	the	matron	is	a	brick.	Yes,	I'll	come."

"Hurrah!"	said	Peter.	"I	tell	you	what:	I'll	meet	you	at	the	cross-roads	below	the hospital	and	bring	you	on.	Will	that	do?	What	time?	Five-thirty?"

"Heavens!	do	you	dine	at	five-thirty?"	demanded	Julie.

"Well,	not	quite,	but	we've	got	to	get	down,"	said	Peter,	laughing.

"All	right,"	said	Julie,	"five-thirty,	and	the	saints	preserve	us.	Look	here,	I	shall chance	it	and	come	in	mufti	if	possible.	No	one	knows	me	here."

"Splendid!"	said	Peter.	"Good-bye,	five-thirty."

"Good-bye,"	said	Langton;	"we'll	go	and	arrange	our	menu."

"There	must	be	champagne,"	called	Julie	merrily	over	her	shoulder,	and	catching his	eye.

The	two	men	watched	her	make	for	the	car	across	the	sunlit	square,	then	they strolled	round	it	towards	a	café.	"Come	on,"	said	Langton;	"let's	have	an appetiser."

From	the	little	marble-topped	table	Peter	watched	the	car	drive	away.

Julie	was	laughing	over	something	with	another	girl.	It	seemed	to conclude	the	morning,	somehow.	He	raised	his	glass	and	looked	at	Langton.

"Well,"	he	said,	"here's	to	reality,	wherever	it	is."

"And	here's	to	getting	along	without	too	much	of	it,"	said	Langton,	smiling	at him.

*	*	*	*	*

The	dinner	was	a	great	success—at	least,	in	the	beginning.	Julie	wore	a	frock	of

some	soft	brown	stuff,	and	Peter	could	hardly	keep	his	eyes	off	her.	He	had never	seen	her	out	of	uniform	before,	and	although	she	was	gay	enough,	she	said and	did	nothing	very	exciting.	If	Hilda	had	been	there	she	need	hardly	have behaved	differently,	and	for	a	while	Peter	was	wholly	delighted.	Then	it	began	to dawn	on	him	that	she	was	playing	up	to	Langton,	and	that	set	in	train	irritating thoughts.	He	watched	the	other	jealously,	and	noticed	how	the	girl	drew	him	out to	speak	of	his	travels,	and	how	excellently	he	did	it,	leaning	back	at	coffee	with his	cigarette,	polite,	pleasant,	attractive.	Julie,	who	usually	smoked	cigarette after	cigarette	furiously,	only,	however,	getting	through	about	half	of	each,	now refused	a	second,	and	glanced	at	the	clock	about	8.30.

"Oh,"	she	said,	"I	must	go."

Peter	remonstrated.	"If	you	can	stay	out	later	at	Havre,"	he	said,	"why	not	here?"

She	laughed	lightly.	"I'm	reforming,"	she	said,	"in	the	absence	of	bad companions.	Besides,	they	are	used	to	my	being	later	at	Havre,	but	here	I	might be	spotted,	and	then	there	would	be	trouble.	Would	you	fetch	my	coat,	Captain Graham?"

Peter	went	obediently,	and	they	all	three	moved	out	into	the	court.

"Come	along	and	see	her	home,	Langton,"	he	said,	though	he	hardly	knew	why he	included	the	other.

"Thanks,"	said	his	friend;	"but	if	Miss	Gamelyn	will	excuse	me,	I	ought	not.	I've got	some	reading	I	must	do	for	to-morrow,	and	I	want	to	write	a	letter	or	two	as well.	You'll	be	an	admirable	escort,	Graham."

"Good-night,"	said	Julie,	holding	out	her	hand;	"perhaps	we	shall	meet	again some	time.	One	is	always	running	up	against	people	in	France.	And	thank	you	so much	for	your	share	of	the	entertainment."

In	a	few	seconds	Peter	and	she	were	outside.	The	street	was	much	darkened,	and there	was	no	moon.	They	walked	in	silence	for	a	little.	Suddenly	he	stopped.

"Wouldn't	you	like	a	cab?"	he	said;	"we	might	be	able	to	get	one."

Julie	laughed	mischievously,	and	Peter	gave	a	little	start	in	the	dark.	It	struck him	that	this	was	the	old	laugh	and	that	he	had	not	heard	it	that	night	before.	"It's convenient,	of	course,"	she	said	mockingly.	"Do	get	one	by	all	means.	But	last

time	I	came	home	with	you	in	a	cab,	you	let	me	finish	alone.	I	thought	that	was to	be	an	invariable	rule."

"Oh,	don't	Julie,"	said	Peter.

Her	tone	changed.	"Why	not?"	she	demanded.	"Solomon,	what's	made	you	so glum	to-night?	You	were	cheerful	enough	when	you	met	me,	and	when	we began;	then	you	got	silent.	What's	the	matter?"

"Nothing,"	he	said.

She	slipped	her	hand	in	his	arm.	"There	is	something,"	she	said.	"Do	tell	me."

"Do	you	like	Langton?"	he	asked.

"Oh,	immensely—why?	Oh,	Lord,	Solomon,	what	do	you	mean?"

"You	were	different	in	his	presence,	Julie,	from	anything	you've	been	before."

They	took	a	few	paces	in	silence;	then	Peter	had	an	idea,	and	glanced	at	her.	She was	laughing	silently	to	herself.	He	let	her	hand	fall	from	his	arm,	and	looked away.	He	knew	he	was	behaving	like	an	ass,	but	he	could	not	help	it.

She	stopped	suddenly.	"Peter,"	she	said,	"I	want	to	talk	to	you.	Take	me somewhere	where	it's	possible."

"At	this	hour	of	the	evening?	What	about	being	late?"

She	gave	a	little	stamp	with	her	foot,	then	laughed	again.	"What	a	boy	it	is!"	she said.	"Don't	you	know	anywhere	to	go?"

Peter	hesitated;	then	he	made	up	his	mind.	There	was	an	hotel	he	knew	of,	out	of the	main	street,	of	none	too	good	a	reputation.	Some	men	had	taken	Langton	and him	there,	once,	in	the	afternoon,	between	the	hours	in	which	drinks	were	legally sold,	and	they	had	gone	through	the	hall	into	a	little	back-room	that	was apparently	partly	a	sitting-room,	partly	part	of	the	private	rooms	of	the	landlord, and	had	been	served	there.	He	recalled	the	description	of	one	of	the	men:	"It's	a place	to	know.	You	can	always	get	a	drink,	and	take	in	anyone	you	please."

"Come	on,	then,"	he	said,	and	turned	down	a	back-street.

"Where	in	the	world	are	you	taking	me?"	demanded	Julie.	"I	shall	have	no reputation	left	if	this	gets	out."

"Nor	shall	I,"	said	Peter.

"Nor	you	will;	what	a	spree!	Do	you	think	it's	worth	it,	Peter?"

Under	a	shaded	lamp	they	were	passing	at	the	moment,	he	glanced	at	her,	and	his pulses	raced!	"Good	God,	Julie!"	he	said,	"you	could	do	anything	with	me."

She	chuckled	with	laughter,	her	brown	eyes	dancing.	"Maybe,"	she	said,	"but	I'm out	to	talk	to	you	for	your	good	now."

They	turned	another	corner,	into	an	old	street,	and	under	an	arch.	Peter	walked forward	to	the	hotel	entrance,	and	entered.	There	was	a	woman	in	the	office,	who glanced	up,	and	looked,	first	at	Peter,	then	at	Julie.	On	seeing	her	behind	him, she	came	forward.	"What	can	I	do	for	monsieur?"	she	asked.

"Good-evening,	madame,"	said	Peter.	"I	was	here	the	other	day.	Give	us	a	bottle of	wine	in	that	little	room	at	the	back,	will	you?"

"Why,	certainly,	monsieur,"	said	she.	"Will	madame	follow	me?	It	is	this	way."

She	opened,	the	door,	and	switched	on	the	light,	"Shall	I	light	the	fire,	madame?"

she	demanded.

Julie	beamed	on	her.	"Ah,	yes;	that	would	be	jolly,"	she	said.	"And	the	wine, madame—Beaune."

The	woman	smiled	and	bowed.	"Let	madame	but	seat	herself	and	it	shall	come,"

she	said,	and	went	out.

Julie	took	off	her	hat,	and	walked	to	the	glass,	patting	her	hair.	"Give	me	a cigarette,	my	dear,"	she	said.	"It	was	jolly	hard	only	to	smoke	one	to-night."

Peter	opened	and	handed	her	his	case	in	silence,	then	pulled	up	a	big	chair.	There was	a	knock	at	the	door,	and	a	girl	came	in	with	the	wine	and	glasses,	which	she set	on	the	table,	and,	then	knelt	down	to	light	the	fire.	She	withdrew	and	shut	the door.	They	were	alone.

Peter	was	still	standing.	Julie	glanced	at	him,	and	pointed	to	a	chair	opposite.

"Give	me	a	drink,	and	then	go	and	sit	there,"	she	said.

He	obeyed.	She	pulled	her	skirts	up	high	to	the	blaze	and	pushed	one	foot	out	to the	logs,	and	sat	there,	provocative,	sipping	her	wine	and	puffing	little	puffs	of smoke	from	her	cigarette.	"Now,	then,"	she	said,	"what	did	I	do	wrong	to-night?"

Peter	was	horribly	uncomfortable.	He	felt	how	little	he	knew	this	girl,	and	he	felt also	how	much	he	loved	her.

"Nothing,	dear,"	he	said;	"I	was	a	beast."

"Well,"	she	said,	"if	you	won't	tell	me,	I'll	tell	you.	I	was	quite	proper	to-night, immensely	and	intensely	proper,	and	you	didn't	like	it.	You	had	never	seen	me so.	You	thought,	too,	that	I	was	making	up	to	your	friend.	Isn't	that	so?"

Peter	nodded.	He	marvelled	that	she	should	know	so	well,	and	he	wondered what	was	coming.

"I	wonder	what	you	really	think	of	me,	Peter,"	she	went	on.	"I	suppose	you	think I	never	can	be	serious—no,	I	won't	say	serious—conventional.	But	you're	very stupid;	we	all	of	us	can	be,	and	must	be	sometimes.	You	asked	me	just	now	what I	thought	of	your	friend—well,	I'll	tell	you.	He	is	as	different	from	you	as possible.	He	has	his	thoughts,	no	doubt,	but	he	prefers	to	be	very	tidy.	He	takes refuge	in	the	things	you	throw	overboard.	He's	not	at	all	my	sort,	and	he's	not yours	either,	in	a	way.	Goodness	knows	what	will	happen	to	either	of	us,	but	he'll be	Captain	Langton	to	the	end	of	his	days.	I	envy	that	sort	of	person	intensely, and	when	I	meet	him	I	put	on	armour.	See?"

Peter	stared	at	her.	"How	is	he	different	from	Donovan?"	he	asked.

"Donovan!	Oh,	Lord,	Peter,	how	dull	you	are!	Donovan	has	hardly	a	thought	in his	head	about	anything	except	Donovan.	He	was	born	a	jolly	good	sort,	and	he's sampled	pretty	well	everything.	He's	cool	as	a	cucumber,	though	he	has	his passions	like	everyone	else.	If	you	keep	your	head,	you	can	say	or	do	anything with	Donovan.	But	Langton	is	deliberate.	He	knows	about	things,	and	he	refuses and	chooses.	I	didn't	want	…"	She	broke	off.	"Peter,"	she	said	savagely,	"in	two minutes	that	man	would	know	more	about	me	than	you	do,	if	I	let	him."

He	had	never	seen	her	so.	The	childish	brown	eyes	had	a	look	in	them	that

reminded	him	of	an	animal	caught	in	a	trap.	He	sprang	up	and	dropped	on	his knees	by	her	side,	catching	her	hand.

"Oh,	Julie,	don't,"	he	said.	"What	do	you	mean?	What	is	there	about	you	that	I don't	know?	How	are	you	different	from	either	of	them?"

She	threw	her	cigarette	away,	and	ran	her	fingers	through	his	hair,	then	made	a gesture,	almost	as	if	pushing	something	away,	Peter	thought,	and	laughed	her	old ringing	trill	of	laughter.

"Lor',	Peter,	was	I	tragic?	I	didn't	mean	to	be,	my	dear.	There's	a	lot	about	me that	you	don't	know,	but	something	that	you've	guessed.	I	can't	abide	shams	and conventions	really.	Let's	have	life,	I	say,	whatever	it	is.	Heavens!	I've	seen	street girls	with	more	in	them	than	I	pretended	to	your	friend	to	have	in	me	to-night.

They	at	least	deal	with	human	nature	in	the	raw.	But	that's	why	I	love	you; there's	no	need	to	pretend	to	you,	partly	because,	at	bottom,	you	like	real	things as	much	as	I,	and	partly	because—oh,	never	mind."

"Julie,	I	do	mind—tell	me,"	he	insisted.

Her	face	changed	again.	"Not	now,	Peter,"	she	said.	"Perhaps	one	day—who	can say?	Meantime,	go	on	liking	me,	will	you?"

"Like	you!"	he	exclaimed,	springing	up,	"Why,	I	adore	you!	I	love	you!

Oh,	Julie,	I	love	you!	Kiss	me,	darling,	now,	quick!"

She	pushed	him	off.	"Not	now,"	she	cried;	"I've	got	to	have	my	revenge.	I	know why	you	wouldn't	come	home	in	the	cab!	Come!	we'll	clink	glasses,	but	that's	all there	is	to	be	done	to-night!"	She	sprang	up,	flushed	and	glowing,	and	held	out an	empty	glass.

Peter	filled	hers	and	his,	and	they	stood	opposite	to	each	other.	She	looked	across the	wine	at	him,	and	it	seemed	to	him	that	he	read	a	longing	and	a	passion	in	her eyes,	deep	down	below	the	merriness	that	was	there	now.	"Cheerio,	old	boy,"	she said,	raising	hers.	"And	'here's	to	the	day	when	your	big	boots	and	my	little shoes	lie	outside	the	same	closed	door!'"

"Julie!"	he	said,	"you	don't	mean	it!"

"Don't	I?	How	do	you	know,	old	sober-sides.	Come,	buck	up,	Solomon;	we've

been	sentimental	long	enough.	I'd	like	to	go	to	a	music-hall	now	or	do	a	skirt-dance.	But	neither's	really	possible;	certainly	not	the	first,	and	you'd	be	shocked at	the	second.	I'm	half	a	mind	to	shock	you,	though,	only	my	skirt's	not	long	and wide	enough,	and	I've	not	enough	lace	underneath.	I'll	spare	you.	Come	on!"

She	seized	her	hat	and	put	it	on.	They	went	out	into	the	hall.	There	was	a	man	in uniform	there,	at	the	office,	and	a	girl,	French	and	unmistakable,	who	glanced	at Julie,	and	then	turned	away.	Julie	nodded	to	madame,	and	did	not	glance	at	the man,	but	as	she	passed	the	girl	she	said	distinctly,	"Bon	soir,	mademoiselle."	The girl	started	and	turned	towards	her.	Julie	smiled	sweetly	and	passed	on.

Peter	took	her	arm	in	the	street,	for	it	was	quite	dark	and	deserted.

"Why	did	you	do	that?"	he	said.

"What?"	she	demanded.

"Speak	to	that	girl.	You	know	what	she	is?"

"I	do—a	poor	devil	that's	playing	with	Fate	for	the	sake	of	a	laugh	and	a	bit	of ribbon.	I'm	jolly	sorry	for	her,	for	they	are	both	worth	a	great	deal,	and	it's	hard to	be	cheated	into	thinking	you've	got	them	when	Fate	is	really	winning	the	deal.

And	I	saw	her	face	before	she	turned	away.	Why	do	you	think	she	turned	away, Peter?	Not	because	she	was	ashamed,	but	because	she	is	beginning	to	know	that Fate	wins.	Oh,	la!	la!	what	a	world!	Let's	be	more	cheerful. 'There's	a	long,	long trail	a-winding.' "	she	hummed.

Peter	laughed.	"Oh,	my	dear,"	he	said,	"was	there	ever	anyone	like	you?"

Langton	was	reading	in	his	room	when	Peter	looked	in	to	say	good-night.

"Hullo!"	he	said.	"See	her	home?"

"Yes,"	said	Peter.	"What	did	you	think	of	her?"

"She's	fathoms	deep,	I	should	say.	But	I	should	take	care	if	I	were	you,	my	boy.

It's	all	very	well	to	eat	and	drink	with	publicans	and	sinners,	though,	as	I	told you,	it's	better	no	one	should	know.	But	they	are	dangerous	company."

"Why	especially?"	demanded	Peter.

Langton	stretched	himself.	"Oh,	I	don't	know,"	he	said.	"Perhaps	because society's	agin	'em."

"Look	here,	Langton,"	said	Peter.	"Do	you	hear	what	I	say? Damn	society!

Besides,	do	you	think	your	description	applies	to	that	girl?"

Langton	smiled.	"No,"	he	said,	"I	shouldn't	think	so,	but	she's	not	your	sort, Peter.	When	you	take	that	tunic	off,	you've	got	to	put	on	a	black	coat.	Whatever conclusions	you	come	to,	don't	forget	that."

"Have	I?"	said	Peter;	"I	wonder."

Langton	got	up.	"Of	course	you	have,"	he	said.	"Life's	a	bit	of	a	farce,	but	one's got	to	play	it.	See	here,	I	believe	in	facing	facts	and	getting	one's	eyes	open,	but not	in	making	oneself	a	fool.	Nothing's	worth	that."

"Isn't	it?"	said	Peter;	and	again,	"I	wonder."

"Well,	I	don't,	and	at	any	rate	I'm	for	bed.	Good-night."

"Good-night,"	said	Peter;	"I'm	off	too.	But	I	don't	agree	with	you.	I'm	inclined	to think	exactly	the	opposite—that	anything	worth	having	is	worth	making	oneself a	fool	over.	What	is	a	fool,	anyway?	Good-night."

He	closed	the	door,	and	Langton	walked	over	to	the	window	to	open	it.	He	stood there	a	few	minutes	listening	to	the	silence.	Then	a	cock	crew	somewhere,	and was	answered	far	away	by	another.	"Yes,"	said	Langton	to	himself,	"what	is	a fool,	anyway?"





CHAPTER	II

The	Lessing	family	sat	at	dinner,	and	it	was	to	be	observed	that	some	of	those incredible	wonders	at	which	Peter	Graham	had	once	hinted	to	Hilda	had	come about.	There	were	only	three	courses,	and	Mr.	Lessing	had	but	one	glass	of	wine, for	one	thing;	for	another	he	was	actually	in	uniform,	and	was	far	more	proud	of his	corporal's	stripes	than	he	had	previously	been	of	his	churchwarden's	staff	of office.	Nor	was	he	only	in	the	Volunteers;	he	was	actually	in	training	to	some extent,	and	the	war	had	at	any	rate	done	him	good.	His	wife	was	not	dressed	for dinner	either;	she	had	just	come	in	from	a	war	committee	of	some	sort.	A	solitary maid	waited	on	them,	and	they	had	already	given	up	fires	in	the	dining-room.

Not	that	Mr.	Lessing's	income	had	appreciably	diminished,	but,	quite	honestly, he	and	his	were	out	to	win	the	war.	He	had	come	to	the	conclusion	at	last	that business	could	not	go	on	as	usual,	but,	routed	out	of	that	stronghold,	he	had made	for	himself	another.	The	war	was	now	to	him	a	business.	He	viewed	it	in that	light.

"We	must	stop	them,"	he	was	saying.	"Mark	my	words,	they'll	never	get	to Amiens.	Did	you	see	Haig's	last	order	to	the	troops?	Not	another	inch	was	to	be given	at	any	cost.	We	shan't	give	either.	We've	 got	to	win	this	war;	there's	too much	at	stake	for	us	to	lose.	Whoever	has	to	foot	the	bill	for	this	business	is ruined,	and	it's	not	going	to	be	Great	Britain.	They	were	saying	in	the	Hall	to-night	that	the	Army	is	as	cheerful	as	possible:	that's	the	best	sign.	I	doubt	the German	Army	is.	Doesn't	Graham	say	anything	about	it,	Hilda?"

"No,	father,"	said	Hilda	shortly,	and	bent	over	her	plate.

"'Xtraordinary	thing.	He's	a	smart	chap,	and	I	should	have	thought	he'd	have been	full	of	it.	Perhaps	he's	too	far	back."

"He	was	in	a	big	town	he	doesn't	name	the	other	day,	in	an	air-raid,	and	a	man was	killed	in	his	carriage."

"Good	Lord!	you	don't	say	so?	When	did	you	hear	that?	I	thought	we	had command	of	the	air."

"I	got	a	letter	to-night,	father.	He	just	mentioned	that,	but	he	doesn't	say	much else	about	it.	He's	at	Abbeville	now,	on	the	Somme,	and	he	says	the	Germans come	over	fairly	often	by	night."

"Impossible!"	snorted	the	old	man,	"I	have	it	on	the	best	possible	authority	that our	air	service	is	completely	up	to	date	now,	and	far	better	than	the	German.	He must	be	exaggerating.	They	would	never	allow	the	enemy	to	out-distance	us	in so	important	a	department.	What	else	does	he	say?"

"Oh,	nothing;"	said	Hilda,	"or	at	least	nothing	about	the	war	in	a	way.

It's	full	of—of	his	work."	She	stopped	abruptly.

"Well,	well,"	said	Mr.	Lessing,	"I	was	against	his	going	at	first;	but	it's	all shoulders	to	the	wheel	now,	and	it	was	plain	he	ought	to	see	a	little	life	out	there.

A	young	man	who	doesn't	won't	have	much	of	a	look	in	afterwards—that's	how	 I reasoned	it.	And	he	works	hard,	does	Graham;	I've	always	said	that	for	him,	I expect	he's	of	great	service	to	them.	Eh,	Hilda?"

"I	don't	know,"	said	the	girl;	"he	doesn't	say.	But	he's	been	chosen	for	some special	work,	lecturing	or	something,	and	that's	why	he's	at	Abbeville."

"Ah!	Good!	Special	work,	eh?	He'll	go	far	yet,	that	fellow.	I	don't	know	that	I'd have	chosen	him	for	you,	Hilda,	at	first,	but	this	business	has	shaken	us	all	up, and	I	shouldn't	be	surprised	if	Graham	comes	to	the	front	over	it."	He	stopped	as the	maid	came	in,	"I	think	I'll	have	my	coffee	in	the	study,	my	dear,"	he	said	to Mrs.	Lessing;	"I	have	some	reading	to	do."

When	the	two	women	were	once	more	alone	Mrs.	Lessing	put	her	cup	down,	and spoke.	"What	is	it,	dear?"	she	questioned.

Hilda	did	not	look	at	her.	The	two,	indeed,	understood	each	other	very	well.	"I can't	tell	you	here,	mother,"	she	said.

"Come,	then,	dear,"	said	Mrs.	Lessing,	rising.	"Let's	go	to	my	room.	Your	father will	be	busy	for	some	time,	and	we	shall	not	be	disturbed	there."

She	led	the	way,	and	lit	a	small	gas	fire.	"I	can't	be	cold	in	my	bedroom,"	she

said;	"and	though	I	hate	these	things,	they	are	better	than	nothing.	Now,	dear, what	is	it?"

Hilda	seated	herself	on	a	footstool	on	the	other	side	of	the	fire,	and stared	into	it.	The	light	shone	on	her	fair	skin	and	hair,	and	Mrs.

Lessing	contemplated	her	with	satisfaction	from	several	points	of	view.

For	one	thing,	Hilda	was	so	sensible….

"What	is	it?"	she	asked	again.	"Your	father	saw	nothing—men	don't;	but	you can't	hide	from	me,	dear,	that	your	letter	has	troubled	you.	Is	Peter	in	trouble?"

Hilda	shook	her	head.	Then	she	said:	"Well,	at	least,	mother,	not	that	sort	of trouble.	I	told	father	truly;	he's	been	picked	for	special	service."

"Well,	then,	what	is	it?"	Mrs.	Lessing	was	a	trifle	impatient.

"Mother,"	said	Hilda,	"I've	known	that	he	has	not	been	happy	ever	since	his arrival	in	France,	but	I've	never	properly	understood	why.	Peter	is	queer	in	some ways,	you	know.	You	remember	that	sermon	of	his?	He	won't	be	content	with things;	he's	always	worrying.	And	now	he	writes	dreadfully.	He	says…"	She hesitated.	Then,	suddenly,	she	pulled	out	the	letter.	"Listen,	mother,"	she	said, and	read	what	Peter	had	written	in	the	club	until	the	end.	"'I	am	going	to	eat	and drink	with	publicans	and	sinners;	maybe	I	shall	find	my	Master	still	there.'"

If	Langton	could	have	seen	Mrs.	Lessing	he	would	have	smiled	that	cynical smile	of	his	with	much	satisfaction.	She	was	frankly	horrified—rendered,	in	fact, almost	speechless.

"Hilda!"	she	exclaimed.	"What	a	thing	to	write	to	you!	But	what	does	he	mean?

Has	he	forgotten	that	he	is	a	clergyman?	Why,	it's	positively	blasphemous!	He	is speaking	of	Christ,	I	suppose.	My	poor	girl,	he	must	be	mad.	Surely	you	see	that, dear."

Hilda	stared	on	into	the	fire,	and	made	no	reply.	Her	mother	hardly	needed	one,

"Has	he	met	another	woman,	Hilda?"	she	demanded.

"I	don't	know;	he	doesn't	say	so,"	said	Hilda	miserably.	"But	anyhow,	I	don't	see that	that	matters."

"Not	matter,	girl!	Are	you	mad	too?	He	is	your	fiancé,	isn't	he?	Really,

I	think	I	must	speak	to	your	father."

Hilda	turned	her	head	slowly,	and	mother	and	daughter	looked	at	each	other.

Mrs.	Lessing	was	a	woman	of	the	world,	but	she	was	a	good	mother,	and	she read	in	her	daughter's	eyes	what	every	mother	has	to	read	sooner	or	later.	It	was as	one	woman	to	another,	and	not	as	mother	to	daughter,	that	she	continued lamely:	"Well,	Hilda,	what	do	you	make	of	it	all?	What	are	you	going	to	do?"

The	girl	looked	away	again,	and	a	silence	fell	between	them.	Then	she	said, speaking	in	short,	slow	sentences:

"I	will	tell	you	what	I	make	of	it,	mother.	Peter's	gone	beyond	me,	I	think,	now, that	I	have	always	feared	a	little	that	he	might.	Of	course,	he's	impetuous	and headstrong,	but	it	is	more	than	that.	He	feels	differently	from	me,	from	all	of	us.

I	can	see	that,	though	I	don't	understand	him	a	bit.	I	thought"	(her	voice	faltered)

"he	loved	me	more.	He	knows	how	I	wanted	him	to	get	on	in	the	Church,	and how	I	would	have	helped	him.	But	that's	nothing	to	him,	or	next	to	nothing.	I think	he	doesn't	love	me	at	all,	mother,	and	never	really	did."

Mrs.	Lessing	threw	her	head	back.	"Then	he's	a	fool,	my	dear,"	she	said emphatically.	"You're	worth	loving;	you	know	it.	I	should	think	no	more	about him,	Hilda."

Hilda's	hands	tightened	round	her	knees.	"I	can't	do	that,"	she	said.

Mrs.	Lessing	was	impatient	again.	"Do	you	mean,	Hilda,	that	if	he	persists	in this—this	madness,	if	he	gives	up	the	Church,	for	example,	you	will	not	break off	the	engagement?	Mind	you,	that	is	the	point.	Every	young	man	must	have	a bit	of	a	fling,	possibly	even	clergymen,	I	suppose,	and	they	get	over	it.	A sensible	girl	knows	that.	But	if	he	ruins	his	prospects—surely,	Hilda,	you	are	not going	to	be	a	fool?"

The	word	had	been	spoken	again.	Peter	had	had	something	to	say	on	it,	and	now the	gods	gave	Hilda	her	chance.	She	stretched	her	fine	hands	out	to	the	fire,	and a	new	note	came	into	her	voice.

"A	fool,	mother?	Oh	no,	I	shan't	be	a	fool.	A	fool	would	follow	him	to	the	end	of the	world.	A	fool	of	a	woman	would	give	him	all	he	wants	for	the	sake	of	giving, and	be	content	with	nothing	in	return.	I	see	that.	But	I'm	not	made	for	that	sort	of foolery….	No,	I	shan't	be	a	fool."

Mrs.	Lessing	could	not	conceal	her	satisfaction.	"Well,	I	am	sure	I	am	very	glad to	hear	you	say	it,	and	so	would	your	father	be.	We	have	not	brought	you	up carefully	for	nothing,	Hilda.	You	are	a	woman	now,	and	I	don't	believe	in	trying to	force	a	woman	against	her	will,	but	I	am	heartily	glad,	my	dear,	that	you	are so	sensible.	When	you	are	as	old	as	I	am	and	have	a	daughter	of	your	own,	you will	be	glad	that	you	have	behaved	so	to-night."

Hilda	got	up,	and	put	her	hands	behind	her	head,	which	was	a	favourite	posture of	hers.	She	stood	looking	down	at	her	mother	with	a	curious	expression	on	her face.	Mrs.	Lessing	could	make	nothing	of	it;	she	merely	thought	Hilda	"queer"; she	had	travelled	farther	than	she	knew	from	youth.

"Shall	I,	mother?"	said	Hilda.	"Yes,	I	expect	I	shall.	I	have	been	carefully brought	up,	as	you	say,	so	carefully	that	even	now	I	can	only	just	see	what	a	fool might	do,	and	I	know	quite	well	that	I	can't	do	it.	After	a	while	I	shall	no	more see	it	than	you	do.	I	shall	even	probably	forget	that	I	ever	did.	So	that	is	all.	And because	I	love	him,	really,	I	don't	think	I	can	even	say	'poor	Peter!'	That's curious,	isn't	it,	mother?…	Well,	I	think	I'll	go	to	my	room	for	a	little.	I	won't come	in	again.	Good-night."

She	bent	and	kissed	Mrs.	Lessing.	Her	mother	held	her	arms	a	moment	more.

"Then,	what	are	you	going	to	do?"	she	demanded.

Hilda	freed	herself,	"Write	and	try	to	persuade	him	not	to	be	a	fool	either,	I	think.

Not	that	it's	any	good.	And	then—wait	and	see."	She	walked	to	the	floor,	"Of course,	this	is	just	between	us	two,	isn't	it,	dear?"	she	said,	playing	with	the handle.

"Of	course,"	said	her	mother.	"But	do	be	sensible,	dear,	and	don't	wait	too	long.

It	is	much	better	not	to	play	with	these	things—much	better.	And	do	tell	me	how things	go,	darling,	won't	you?"

"Oh	yes,"	said	Hilda	slowly,	"Oh	yes	I'll	tell	you….	Good-night."

She	passed	out	and	closed	the	door	gently	"I	wonder	why	I	can't	cry	to-night?"

she	asked	herself	as	she	went	to	her	room,	and	quite	honestly	she	did	not	know.

Across	the	water	Peter's	affairs	were	speeding	up.	If	Hilda	could	have	seen	him that	night	she	would	probably	have	wept	without	difficulty,	but	for	a	much	more superficial	reason	than	the	reason	why	she	could	not	weep	in	London.	And	it

came	about	in	this	way.

On	the	morning	after	the	dinner	Peter	was	moody,	and	declared	he	would	not	go down	to	the	office,	but	would	take	a	novel	out	to	the	canal.	He	was	in	half	a mind	to	go	up	and	call	at	the	hospital,	but	something	held	him	back.	Reflection showed	him	how	near	he	had	been	to	the	fatal	kiss	the	night	before,	and	he	did not	wish,	or,	with	the	morning,	he	thought	he	did	not	wish,	to	see	Julie	so	soon again.	So	he	got	his	novel	and	went	out	to	the	canal,	finding	a	place	where	last year's	leaves	still	lay	thick,	and	one	could	lie	at	ease	and	read.	We	do	these things	all	our	days,	and	never	learn	the	lesson.

Half-way	through	the	morning	he	looked	up	to	see	Langton	striding	along towards	him.	He	was	walking	quickly,	with	the	air	of	one	who	brings	news,	and he	delivered	his	message	as	soon	as	they	were	within	earshot	of	each	other.

"Good	news,	Graham,"	he	called	out.	"This	tomfoolery	is	over.	They've	heard from	H.Q.	that	the	whole	stunt	is	postponed,	and	we've	all	to	go	back	to	our bases.	Isn't	it	like	'em?"	he	demanded,	as	he	came	up.	"Old	Jackson	in	the	office is	swearing	like	blazes.	He's	had	all	his	maps	made	and	plans	drawn	up,	etcetera and	etcetera,	and	now	they're	so	much	waste-paper.	Jolly	fortunate,	any	road."

He	sat	down	and	got	out	a	pipe.

Peter	shut	his	book.	"I'm	glad,"	he	said.	"I'm	sick	of	foolin'	round	here.	Not	but what	it	isn't	a	decent	enough	place,	but	I	prefer	the	other.	There's	more	doing.

When	do	we	go?"

"To-morrow.	They're	getting	our	movement	orders,	yours	to	Havre,	mine	to Rouen.	I	put	in	a	spoke	for	you,	to	get	one	via	Rouen,	but	I	don't	know	if	you will.	It's	a	vile	journey	otherwise."

"By	Jove!"	cried	Peter.	"I've	an	idea!	Miss	Gamelyn's	troop	of	motor-buses	goes back	to	Havre	to-morrow	empty.	Why	shouldn't	I	travel	on	them?	Think	I	could work	it?"

Langton	puffed	solemnly.	"Sure,	I	should	think,"	he	said,	"being	a	padre, anyway."

"What	had	I	best	do?"

"Oh,	I	should	go	and	see	Jackson	and	get	him	to	'phone	the	hospital	for	you—

that	is,	if	you	really	want	to	go	that	way."

"It's	far	better	than	that	vile	train,"	said	Peter.	"Besides,	one	can	see	the	country, which	I	love.	And	I've	never	been	in	Dieppe,	and	they're	to	go	through	there	and pick	up	some	casualties."

"Just	so,"	said	Langton,	still	smoking.

"Well,"	said	Peter,	"reckon	I'll	go	and	see	about	it.	Jackson's	a	decent	old	stick, but	I'd	best	do	it	before	he	tackles	the	R.T.O.	Coming?"

"No,"	said	Langton.	"Leave	that	novel,	and	come	back	for	me.	You	won't	be long."

"Right-o,"	said	Peter,	and	set	off.

It	was	easily	done.	Jackson	had	no	objections,	and	rang	up	the	hospital	while Peter	waited.	Oh	yes,	certainly	they	could	do	it.	What	was	the	name?	Captain.

Graham,	C.F.	certainly.	He	must	be	at	the	hospital	early—eight-thirty	the	next morning.	That	all	right?	Thank	you.

"Thank	you,"	said	Peter.	"Motoring's	a	long	sight	better	than	the	train	these	days, and	I'll	get	in	quicker,	too,	as	a	matter	of	fact,	or	at	any	rate	just	as	quickly."	He turned	to	go,	but	a	thought	struck	him.	"Have	you	an	orderly	to	spare?"	he	asked.

"Any	quantity,"	said	the	other	bitterly.	"They've	been	detailed	for	weeks,	and done	nothing.	You	can	have	one	with	pleasure.	It'll	give	the	perisher	something to	do."

"Thanks,"	said	Peter;	"I	want	to	send	a	note,	that's	all.	May	I	write	it	here?"

He	was	given	pen	and	paper,	and	scribbled	a	little	note	to	Julie.	He	did	not	know who	else	might	be	on	the	lorry,	or	if	she	would	want	to	appear	to	know	him.	The orderly	was	called	and	despatched	and	he	left	the	place	for	the	last	time.

Langton	and	he	walked	out	to	St.	Riquier	in	the	afternoon,	had	tea	there,	and	got back	to	dinner.	A	note	was	waiting	for	Peter,	a	characteristic	one.

"DEAREST	SOLOMON	(it	ran),

"You	are	really	waking	up!	There	will	be	three	of	us	nurses	in	one	lorry,	and they're	sure	to	start	you	off	in	another.	We	lunch	at	Eu,	and	I'll	be	delighted	to

see	you.	Then	you	can	go	on	in	our	car.	Dieppe's	on	the	knees	of	the	gods,	as	you say,	but	probably	we	can	pull	off	something.

"JULIE."

He	smiled	and	put	it	in	his	pocket.	Langton	said	nothing	till	the	coffee	and liqueurs	came	in.	Then	he	lit	a	cigarette	and	held	the	match	out	to	Peter.	"Wonder if	we	shall	meet	again?"	he	said.

"Oh,	I	expect	so,"	said	Peter.	"Write,	anyway,	won't	you?	I'll	likely	get	a	chance to	come	to	Rouen."

"And	I	likely	won't	be	there.	I'm	putting	in	again	for	another	job.	They're	short	of men	now,	and	want	equipment	officers	for	the	R.A.F.	It's	a	stunt	for	which engineering's	useful,	and	I	may	get	in.	I	don't	suppose	I'll	see	much	of	the	fun, but	it's	better	than	bossing	up	a	labour	company,	any	road."

"Sportsman,"	said	Peter.	"I	envy	you.	Why	didn't	you	tell	me?	I've	half	a	mind	to put	in	too.	Do	you	think	I'd	have	a	chance?"

"No,"	said	Langton	brutally.	"Besides,	it's	not	your	line.	You	know	what	yours	is; stick	to	it."

"And	you	know	that	I'm	not	so	sure	that	I	can,"	said	Peter.

"Rot!"	said	the	other.	"You	can	if	you	like.	You	won't	gain	by	running	away.

Only	I	give	you	this	bit	of	advice,	old	son:	go	slow.	You're	so	damned	hot-headed!	You	can't	remake	the	world	to	order	in	five	minutes;	and	if	you	could,	I bet	it	wouldn't	be	a	much	better	old	world.	We've	worried	along	for	some	time moderately	well.	Don't	be	too	ready	to	turn	down	the	things	that	have	worked with	some	success,	at	any	rate,	for	the	things	that	have	never	been	tried."

Peter	smoked	in	silence.	Then	he	said:	"Langton	you're	a	bit	different	from	what you	were.	In	a	way,	it's	you	who	have	set	me	out	on	this	racket,	and	it's	you	who encouraged	me	to	try	and	get	down	to	rock-bottom.	You've	always	been	a cautious	old	rotter,	but	you're	more	than	cautious	now.	Why?"

Langton	leaned	over	and	touched	the	other's	tunic	pocket	in	which	lay Julie's	note.	Then	he	leaned	back	and	went	on	with	his	cigarette.

Peter	flushed.	"It's	too	late,"	he	said	judicially,	flicking	off	his	ash.

"So?	Well,	I'm	sorry,	frankly—sorry	for	her	and	sorry	for	you.	But	if	it	is,	I'll remember	my	own	wisdom:	it's	no	use	meddling	with	such	things.	For	all	that, you're	a	fool,	Peter,	as	I	told	you	last	night."

"Just	so.	And	I	asked	what	was	a	fool."

"And	I	didn't	answer.	I	reckon	fools	can	be	of	many	sorts.	Your	sort	of	fool chucks	the	world	over	for	the	quest	of	an	ideal."

"Thank	you,"	said	Peter	quietly.

"You	needn't.	That	fool	is	a	real	fool,	and	bigger	than	most.	Ideals	are	ideals,	and one	can't	realise	them.	It's	waste	of	time	to	try."

"Is	it?"	said	Peter.	"Well,	at	any	rate,	I	don't	know	that	I'm	out	after	them	much.	I don't	see	any.	All	I	know	is	that	I've	looked	in	the	likely	places,	and	now	I'll	look in	the	unlikely."

Langton	ground	his	cigarette-end	in	his	coffee-cup.	"You	will,"	he	said,

"whatever	I	say….	Have	another	drink?	After	all,	there's	no	need	to	'turn	down the	empty	glass'	yet."

They	did	not	see	each	other	in	the	morning,	and	Peter	made	his	way	early	to	the hospital	as	arranged.	The	P.M.O.	met	him,	and	he	was	put	in	nominal	charge	of the	three	Red-Cross	ambulance-cars.	While	he	was	talking	to	the	doctor	the	three nurses	came	out	and	got	in,	Julie	not	looking	in	his	direction;	then	he	climbed	up next	the	driver	of	the	first	car.	"Cheerio,"	said	the	P.M.O.,	and	they	were	off.

It	was	a	dull	day,	and	mists	hung	over	the	water-meadows	by	the	Somme.	For	all that	Peter	enjoyed	himself	immensely.	They	ran	swiftly	through	the	little villages,	under	the	sweeping	trees	all	new-budded	into	green,	and	soon	had vistas	of	the	distant	sea.	The	driver	of	Peter's	car	was	an	observant	fellow,	and	he knew	something	of	gardening.	It	was	he	who	pointed	out	that	the	fruit-trees	had been	indifferently	pruned	or	not	pruned	at	all,	and	that	there	were	fields	no longer	under	the	plough	that	had	been	plainly	so	not	long	before.	In	a	word,	the country	bore	its	war	scars,	although	it	needed	a	clever	eye	to	see	them.

But	Peter	had	little	thought	for	this.	Now	and	again,	at	a	corner,	he	would	glance

back,	his	mind	on	Julie	in	the	following	car,	while	every	church	tower	gave	him pause	for	thought.	He	tried	to	draw	the	man	beside	him	on	religion,	but	without any	success,	though	he	talked	freely	enough	of	other	things.	He	was	for	the Colonies	after	the	war,	he	said.	He'd	knocked	about	a	good	deal	in	France,	and the	taste	for	travel	had	come	to	him.	Canada	appeared	a	land	of	promise;	one could	get	a	farm	easily,	and	his	motor	knowledge	would	be	useful	on	a	farm these	days.	Yes,	he	had	a	pal	out	there,	a	Canadian	who	had	done	his	bit	and been	invalided	out	of	it.	They	corresponded,	and	he	expected	to	get	in	with	him, the	one's	local	knowledge	eking	out	the	other's	technical.	No,	he	wasn't	for marrying	yet	awhile;	he'd	wait	till	he'd	got	a	place	for	the	wife	and	kiddies.	Then he	would.	The	thought	made	him	expand	a	bit,	and	Peter	smiled	to	himself	as	he thought	of	his	conversation	with	Langton	over	the	family	group.	It	struck	him	to test	the	man,	and	as	they	passed	a	wayside	Calvary,	rudely	painted,	he	drew	his attention	to	it.	"What	do	you	think	of	that?"	he	asked.

The	man	glanced	at	it,	and	then	away.	"It's	all	right	for	them	as	like	it,"	he	said.

"Religion's	best	in	a	church,	it	seems	to	me.	I've	seen	chaps	mock	at	them crucifixes,	sir,	same	as	they	wouldn't	if	they'd	only	been	in	church."

"Yes,"	said	Peter;	"but	I	suppose	some	men	have	been	helped	by	them	who	never would	have	been	if	they	had	only	been	in	church.	But	don't	you	think	they're rather	gaudy?"

"Gaudy,	sir?	Meanin'	'ighly	painted?	No,	not	as	I	knows	on.	They're	more	like what	happened,	I	reckon,	than	them	brass	crosses	we	have	in	our	churches."

They	ran	into	Eu	for	lunch,	and	drew	up	in	the	market-square.	Peter	went	round to	the	girls'	car,	greeted	Julie,	and	was	introduced.	He	led	them	to	an	old	inn	in the	square,	and	they	sat	down	to	luncheon	in	very	good	humour.	The	other	girls were	ordinary	enough,	and	Julie	rather	subdued	for	her.	Afterwards	they	spent	an hour	in	the	church	and	a	picture-postcard	shop,	and	it	was	there	that	Julie whispered:	"Go	on	in	your	own	car.	At	Dieppe,	go	to	the	Hôtel	Trois	Poissons and	wait	for	me.	I	found	out	yesterday	that	a	woman	I	know	is	a	doctor	in Dieppe,	and	she	lives	there.	I'll	get	leave	easily	to	call.	Then	I	can	see	you.	If	we travel	together	these	girls'll	talk;	they're	just	the	sort."

Peter	nodded	understanding,	and	they	drifted	apart.	He	went	out	to	see	if	the	cars were	ready	and	returned	to	call	the	nurses,	and	in	a	few	minutes	they	were	off again.

The	road	now	ran	through	forests	nearly	all	the	way,	except	where	villages	had cleared	a	space	around	them,	as	was	plain	to	see.	They	crossed	little	streams,	and finally	came	downhill	through	the	forest	into	the	river	valley	that	leads	to Dieppe.	It	was	still	early,	and	Peter	stopped	the	cars	to	suggest	that	they	might have	a	look	at	the	castle	of	Arques-le-Bataille.	The	grand	old	pile	kept	them nearly	an	hour,	and	they	wandered	about	the	ruins	to	their	hearts'	content.	Julie would	climb	a	buttress	of	the	ancient	keep	when	their	guide	had	gone	on	with the	others,	and	Peter	went	up	after	her.	She	was	as	lissom	as	a	boy	and	seemingly as	strong,	swinging	up	by	roots	of	ivy	and	the	branches	of	a	near	tree,	in	no	wise impeded	by	her	short	skirts.	From	the	top	one	had,	indeed,	a	glorious	view.	The weather	had	cleared	somewhat,	and	one	could	see	every	bit	of	the	old	castle below,	the	village	at	its	feet,	and	the	forest	across	the	little	stream	out	of	which the	Duke	of	Mayenne's	infantry	had	debouched	that	day	of	battle	from	which	the village	took	its	name.

"They	had	some	of	the	first	guns	in	the	castle,	which	was	held	for	Henry	of Navarre,"	explained	Peter,	"and	they	did	great	execution.	I	suppose	they	fired one	stone	shot	in	about	every	five	minutes,	and	killed	a	man	about	every	half-hour.	The	enemy	were	more	frightened	than	hurt,	I	should	think.	Anyway,	Henry won."

"Wasn't	he	the	King	who	thought	Paris	worth	more	than	a	Mass?"	she	demanded.

"Yes,"	said	Peter,	watching	her	brown	eyes	as	she	stared	out	over	the	plain.

"I	wonder	what	he	thinks	now,"	she	said.

He	laughed.	"You're	likely	to	wonder,"	he	said.

"Funny	old	days,"	said	Julie.	"I	suppose	there	were	girls	in	this	castle	watching the	fight.	I	expect	they	cared	more	for	the	one	man	each	half-hour	the	cannon	hit than	for	either	Paris	or	the	Mass.	That's	the	way	of	women,	Peter,	and	a	damned silly	way	it	is!	Come	on,	let's	go.	I'll	get	down	first,	if	you	please."

On	the	short	road	remaining	Peter	asked	his	chauffeur	if	he	knew	the	Trois Poissons,	and,	finding	that	he	did,	had	the	direction	pointed	out.	They	ran through	the	town	to	the	hospital,	and	Peter	handed	his	cars	over.	"I'll	sleep	in town,"	he	said.	"What	time	ought	we	to	start	in	the	morning?"	He	was	told,	and walked	away.	Julie	had	disappeared.

He	found	the	Trois	Poissons	without	difficulty,	and	made	his	way	to	the	sitting-room,	a	queer	room	opening	from	the	pavement	direct	on	the	one	side,	and	from the	hall	of	the	hotel	on	the	other.	It	had	a	table	down	the	middle,	a	weird selection	of	chairs,	and	a	piano.	A	small	woman	was	sitting	in	a	chair	reading	the Tatler	and	smoking.	An	empty	glass	stood	beside	her.

She	looked	up	as	he	came	in,	and	he	noticed	R.A.M.C.	badges.

"Good-evening,"	he	said	cheerily.

"Good-evening,	padre,"	she	replied,	plainly	willing	to	talk.	"Where	have	you sprung	from?"

"Abbeville	via	Eu	in	a	convoy	of	Red	Cross	cars,"	he	said,	"and	I	feel	like	a	sun-downer.	Won't	you	have	another	with	me?"

"Sure	thing,"	she	said,	and	he	ordered	a	couple	from	the	French	maid	who	came in	answer	to	his	ring.	"Do	you	live	here?"	he	asked.

"For	my	sins	I	do,"	she	said.	"I	doctor	Waac's,	and	I	don't	think	much	of	it.	A finer,	heartier	lot	of	women	I	never	saw.	Epsom	salts	is	all	they	want.	A	child could	do	it."

Peter	laughed.	"Well,	I	don't	see	why	you	should	grumble,"	he	said.

"Don't	you?	Where's	the	practice?	This	business	out	here	is	the	best	chance	for doctors	in	a	lifetime,	and	I	have	to	strip	strapping	girls	hopelessly	and	endlessly."

"You	do,	do	you?"	said	a	voice	in	the	doorway,	and	there	stood	Julie.	"Well,	at any	rate	you	oughtn't	to	talk	about	it	like	that	to	my	gentleman	friends,	especially padres.	How	do	you	do,	my	dear?"

"Julie,	by	all	that's	holy!	Where	have	you	sprung	from?"

She	glanced	from	one	to	the	other.	"From	Abbeville	via	Eu	in	a	convoy	of Red	Cross	cars,	I	dare	bet,"	she	said.

"Julie,	you're	beyond	me.	If	you	weren't	so	strong	I'd	smack	you,	but	as	it	is,	give me	another	kiss. And	introduce	us.	There	may	as	well	be	propriety	somewhere."

They	sorted	themselves	out	and	sat	down.	"What	do	you	think	of	my	rig?"

demanded	Dr.	Melville	(as	Julie	had	introduced	her).

"Toppin',"	said	Julie	critically.	"But	what	in	the	world	is	it?	Chiefly	Waac,	with three	pukka	stars	and	an	R.A.M.C.	badge.	Teanie,	how	dare	you	do	it?"

"I	dare	do	all	that	doth	become	a	woman,"	she	answered	complacently.	"And	it doth,	doth	it	not?	Skirt's	a	trifle	short,	perhaps,"	she	added,	sticking	out	a	leg	and examining	the	effect	critically,	"but	upper's	eminently	satisfactory."

Julie	leaned	over	and	prodded	her.	"No	corsets?"	she	inquired	innocently.

"Julie,	you're	positively	indecent.	You	must	have	tamed	your	padre	completely.

You're	not	married	by	any	chance?"	she	added	suddenly.

Julie	screamed	with	laughter.	"Oh,	Teanie,	you'll	be	the	death	of	me,"	she	said	at last.	"Solomon,	are	we	married?	I	don't	think	so,	Teanie.	There's	never	no	telling these	days,	but	I	can't	recollect	it."

"Well,	it	strikes	me	you	ought	to	be	if	you're	jogging	round	the	country together,"	said	the	other,	her	eyes	twinkling.	"But	if	you're	not,	take	warning, padre.	A	girl	that	talks	about	corsets	in	public	isn't	respectable,	especially	as	she doesn't	wear	them	herself,	except	in	the	evening,	for	the	sake	of	other	things.	Or she	used	not	to.	But	perhaps	you	know?"

Peter	tried	to	look	comfortable,	but	he	was	completely	out	of	his	depth.	He finished	his	drink	with	a	happy	inspiration,	and	ordered	another.	That	down,	he began	to	feel	more	capable	of	entering	into	the	spirit	of	these	two.	They	were	the sort	he	wanted	to	know,	both	of	them,	women	about	as	different	from	those	he had	met	as	they	could	possibly	be.

Another	man	dropped	in	after	a	while,	so	the	talk	became	general.	The atmosphere	was	very	free	and	easy,	bantering,	careless,	jolly,	and	Peter	expanded in	it.	Julie	led	them	all.	She	was	never	at	a	loss,	and	apparently	had	no	care	in	the world.

The	two	girls	and	Peter	went	together	to	dinner	and	sat	at	the	same	table.	They talked	a	good	deal	together,	and	Peter	gathered	they	had	come	to	know	each other	at	a	hospital	in	England.	They	were	full	of	reminiscences.

"Do	you	remember	ducking	Pockett?"	Teanie	asked	Julie.

"Lor',	I	should	think	I	do!	Tell	Peter.	He	won't	be	horrified	unless	you	go	into details.	If	I	cough,	Solomon,	you're	to	change	the	subject.	Carry	on,	Teanie."

"Well,	Pockett	was	a	nurse	of	about	the	last	limit.	She	was	fearfully	snobby, which	nobody	of	that	name	ought	to	be,	and	she	ruled	her	pros.	with	a	rod	of iron.	I	expect	that	was	good	for	them,	and	I	say	nothing	as	to	that,	but	she	was	a beast	to	the	boys.	We	had	some	poor	chaps	in	who	were	damnably	knocked about,	and	one	could	do	a	lot	for	them	in	roundabout	ways.	Regulations	are made	to	be	broken	in	some	cases,	I	think.	But	she	was	a	holy	terror.	Sooner	than call	her,	the	boys	would	endure	anything,	but	some	of	us	knew,	and	once	she caught	Julie	here…"

"It	wasn't—it	was	you,	Teanie."

"Oh,	well,	one	of	us,	anyway,	in	her	ward	when	she	was	on	night	duty,	sitting with	a	poor	chap	who	pegged	out	a	few	days	after.	It	soothed	him	to	sit	and	hold her	hand.	Well,	anyway,	she	was	furious	and	reported	it.	There	was	a	bit	of	a	row

—had	to	be,	I	suppose,	as	it	was	against	regulations—but	thank	God	the	P.M.O.

knew	his	job,	so	there	was	only	a	strafe	with	the	tongue	in	the	cheek.	However, we	swore	revenge,	and	we	had	it—eh,	Julie?"

"We	did.	Go	on.	It	was	you	who	thought	of	it."

"Well,	we	filled	a	bath	with	tepid	water	and	then	went	to	her	room	one	night.	She was	asleep,	and	never	heard	us.	We	had	a	towel	round	her	head	in	two	twinks, and	carried	her	by	the	legs	and	arms	to	the	bathroom.	Julie	had	her	legs,	and	held

'em	well	up,	so	that	down	went	her	head	under	water.	She	couldn't	yell	then.

When	we	let	her	up,	I	douched	her	with	cold	water,	and	then	we	bolted.	We	saw to	it	that	there	wasn't	a	towel	in	the	bathroom,	and	we	locked	her	bedroom	door.

Oh,	lor',	poor	soul,	but	it	was	funny!	She	met	an	orderly	in	the	corridor,	and	he nearly	had	a	fit,	and	I	don't	wonder,	for	her	wet	nightie	clung	to	her	figure	like	a skin.	She	had	to	try	half	a	dozen	rooms	before	she	got	anyone	to	help	her,	and then,	when	she	got	back,	we'd	ragged	her	room	to	blazes.	She	never	said	a	word, and	left	soon	after.	Ever	hear	of	her	again,	Julie?"

"No,"	said	she,	looking	more	innocent	than	ever,	Peter	thought;	"but	I	expect she's	made	good	somewhere.	She	must	have	had	something	in	her	or	she'd	have kicked	up	a	row."

Miss	Melville	was	laughing	silently.	"You	innocent	babe	unborn,"	she	said;

"never	shall	I	forget	how	you	held…."

"Come	on,	Captain	Graham,"	said	Julie,	getting	up;	"you've	got	to	see	me	home, and	I	want	a	nice	walk	by	the	sea-front."

They	went	out	together,	and	stood	at	the	hotel	door	in	the	little	street.	There	was a	bit	of	a	moon,	with	clouds	scurrying	by,	and	when	it	shone	the	road	was	damp and	glistening	in	the	moonlight.	"What	a	heavenly	night!"	said	Julie.	"Come	on with	us	along	the	sea-front,	Teanie—do!"

Miss	Melville	smiled	up	at	them.	"I	reckon	you'd	prefer	to	be	alone,"	she	said.

Peter	glanced	at	Julie,	and	then	protested.	"No,"	he	said;	"do	come	on,"	and	Julie rewarded	him	with	a	smile.

So	they	set	out	together.	On	the	front	the	wind	was	higher,	lashing	the	waves, and	the	moonlight	shone	fitfully	on	the	distant	cliffs,	the	harbour	mouth,	and	the sea.	The	two	girls	clung	together,	and	as	Peter	walked	by	Julie	she	took	his	arm.

Conversation	was	difficult	as	they	battled	their	way	along	the	promenade.	There was	hardly	a	soul	about,	and	Peter	felt	the	night	to	fit	his	mood.

They	went	up	once	and	down	again,	and	at	the	Casino	grounds	Teanie	stopped them.	"'Nough,"	she	said;	"I'm	for	home	and	bed.	You	two	dears	can	finish	up without	me."

"Oh,	we	must	see	you	home,"	said	Peter.

The	doctor	laughed.	"Think	I	shall	get	stolen?"	she	demanded.	"Someone	would have	to	get	up	pretty	early	for	that.	No,	padre,	I'm	past	the	need	of	being escorted,	thanks.	Good-night.	Be	good,	Julie.	We'll	meet	again	sometime,	I	hope.

If	not,	keep	smiling.	Cheerio."

She	waved	her	hand	and	was	gone	in	the	night.	"If	there	was	ever	a	plucky, unselfish,	rattling	good	woman,	there	she	goes,"	said	Julie.	"I've	known	her	sit up	night	after	night	with	wounded	men	when	she	was	working	like	a	horse	all day.	I've	known	her	to	help	a	drunken	Tommy	into	a	cab	and	get	him	home,	and quiet	his	wife	into	the	bargain.	I	saw	her	once	walk	off	out	of	the	Monico	with	a boy	of	a	subaltern,	who	didn't	know	what	he	was	doing,	and	take	him	to	her	own flat,	and	put	him	to	bed,	and	get	him	on	to	the	leave-train	in	time	in	the	morning.

She'd	give	away	her	last	penny,	and	you	wouldn't	know	she'd	done	it.	And	yet

she's	not	the	sort	of	woman	you'd	choose	to	run	a	mother's	meeting,	would	you, Solomon?"

"Sure	thing	I	wouldn't,"	said	Peter,	"not	in	my	old	parish,	but	I'm	not	so	sure	I wouldn't	in	my	new	one."

"What's	your	new	one?"	asked	Julie	curiously.

"Oh,	it	hasn't	a	name,"	said	Peter,	"but	it's	pretty	big.	Something	after	the	style	of John	Wesley's	parish,	I	reckon.	And	I'm	gradually	getting	it	sized	up."

"Where	do	I	come	in,	Solomon?"	demanded	Julie.

They	were	passing	by	the	big	Calvary	at	the	harbour	gates,	and	there	was	a	light there.	He	stopped	and	turned	so	that	the	light	fell	on	her.	She	looked	up	at	him, and	so	they	stood	a	minute.	He	could	hear	the	lash	of	the	waves,	and	the	wind drumming	in	the	rigging	of	the	flagstaff	near	them.	Then,	deliberately,	he	bent down,	and	kissed	her	on	the	lips.	"I	don't	know,	Julie,"	he	said,	"but	I	believe	you have	the	biggest	part,	somehow."





CHAPTER	III

All	that	it	is	necessary	to	know	of	Hilda's	return	letter	to	Peter	ran	as	follows:

"My	Dear	Boy,

"Your	letter	from	Abbeville	reached	me	the	day	before	yesterday,	and	I	have thought	about	nothing	else	since.	It	is	plain	to	me	that	it	is	no	use	arguing	with you	and	no	good	reproaching	you,	for	once	you	get	an	idea	into	your	head nothing	but	bitter	experience	will	drive	it	out.	But,	Peter,	you	must	see	that	so	far as	I	am	concerned	you	are	asking	me	to	choose	between	you	and	your	strange ideas	and	all	that	is	familiar	and	dear	in	my	life.	You	can't	honestly	expect	me	to believe	that	my	Church	and	my	parents	and	my	teachers	are	all	wrong,	and	that, to	put	it	mildly,	the	very	strange	people	you	appear	to	be	meeting	in	France	are all	right.	My	dear	Peter,	do	try	and	look	at	it	sensibly.	The	story	you	told	me	of the	death	of	Lieutenant	Jenks	was	terrible—terrible;	it	brings	the	war	home	in	all its	ghastly	reality;	but	really,	you	know,	it	was	his	fault	and	not	yours,	and	still less	the	fault	of	the	Church	of	England,	that	he	did	not	want	you	when	he	came to	die.	If	a	man	lives	without	God,	he	can	hardly	expect	to	find	Him	at	the	point of	sudden	death.	What	you	say	about	Christ,	too,	utterly	bewilders	me.	Surely our	Church's	teachings	in	the	Catechism	and	the	Prayer-Book	is	Christian teaching,	isn't	it?	Nothing	is	perfect	on	earth,	and	the	Church	is	human,	but	our Church	is	certainly	the	best	I	know	of.	It	is	liberal,	active,	moderate,	and—I	don't like	the	word,	but	after	all	it	is	a	good	one—respectable.	I	don't	know	much about	these	things,	but	surely	you	of	all	people	don't	want	to	go	shouting	in	the street	like	a	Salvation	Army	Captain.	I	can't	see	that	that	is	more	'in	touch	with reality.'	Peter,	what	do	you	mean?	Are	not	St.	John's,	and	the	Canon,	and	my people,	and	myself,	real?	Surely,	Peter,	our	love	is	real,	isn't	it?	Oh,	how	can	you doubt	that?

"Darling	boy,	don't	you	think	you	are	over-strained	and	over-worried?	You	are	in a	strange	country,	among	strange	people,	at	a	very	peculiar	time.	War	always

upsets	everything	and	makes	things	abnormal.	London,	even,	isn't	normal,	but, as	the	Canon	said	the	other	day,	a	great	many	of	the	things	people	do	just	now are	due	to	reaction	against	strain	and	anxiety.	Can't	you	see	this?	Isn't	there	any clergyman	you	can	go	and	talk	to?	Your	Presbyterian	and	other	new	friends	and your	visits	to	Roman	Catholic	churches	can't	be	any	real	help.

"Peter,	dear,	for	my	sake,	do, do	try	to	see	things	like	this.	I	 hate	that	bit	in	your letter	about	publicans	and	sinners.	How	can	a	clergyman	expect	 them	to	help him?	Surely	you	ought	to	avoid	such	people,	not	seek	their	company.	It	is	so	like you	to	get	hold	of	a	text	or	two	and	run	it	to	death.	It's	not	that	I	don't	 trust	you, but	you	are	so	easily	influenced,	and	you	may	equally	easily	go	and	do something	that	will	separate	us	and	ruin	your	life.	Peter,	I	hate	to	write	like	this, but	I	can't	help	it…."

Peter	let	the	sheets	fall	from	his	hands	and	stared	out	of	the	little	window.	The gulls	were	screaming	and	fighting	over	some	refuse	in	the	harbour,	and	he watched	the	beat	of	their	wings,	fascinated.	If	only	he,	too,	could	catch	the	wind and	be	up	and	away	like	that!

He	jumped	up	and	paced	up	and	down	the	floor	restlessly,	and	he	told	himself that	Hilda	was	right	and	he	was	a	cad	and	worse.	Julie's	kiss	on	his	lips	burned there	yet.	That	at	any	rate	was	wrong;	by	any	standards	he	had	no	right	to	behave so.	How	could	he	kiss	her	when	he	was	pledged	to	Hilda—Hilda	to	whom everyone	had	looked	up,	the	capable,	lady-like,	irreproachable	Hilda,	the	Hilda to	whom	Park	Lane	and	St.	John's	were	such	admirable	setting.	And	who	was	he, after	all,	to	set	aside	all	that	for	which	both	those	things	stood?

And	yet….	He	sat	down	by	the	little	table	and	groaned.

"What	the	dickens	is	the	matter	with	you,	padre?"

Peter	started	and	looked	round.	In	the	doorway	stood	Pennell,	regarding	him with	amusement.	"Here	am	I	trying	to	read,	and	you	pacing	up	and	down	like	a wild	beast.	What	the	devil's	up?"

"The	devil	himself,	that's	what's	up,"	said	Peter	savagely.	"Look	here, Pen,	come	on	down	town	and	let's	have	a	spree.	I	hate	this	place	and	this infernal	camp.	It	gets	on	my	nerves.	I	must	have	a	change.	Will	you	come?

It's	my	do."

"I'm	with	you,	old	thing.	I	know	what	you	feel	like;	I	get	like	that	myself sometimes.	It's	a	pleasure	to	see	that	you're	so	human.	We'll	go	down	town	and razzle-dazzle	for	once.	I'm	off	duty	till	to-night.	I	ought	to	sleep,	I	suppose,	but	I can't,	so	come	away	with	you.	I	won't	be	a	second."

He	disappeared.	Peter	stood	for	a	moment,	then	slipped	his	tunic	off	and	put	on another	less	distinctive	of	his	office.	He	crossed	to	the	desk,	unlocked	it,	and reached	for	a	roll	of	notes,	shoving	them	into	his	pocket.	Then	he	put	on	his	cap, took	a	stick	from	the	corner,	and	went	out	into	the	passage.	But	there	he remembered,	and	came	quickly	back.	He	folded	Hilda's	letter	and	put	it	away	in a	drawer;	then	he	went	out	again.	"Are	you	ready,	Pennell?"	he	called.

The	two	of	them	left	camp	and	set	out	across	the	docks.	As	they	crossed	a	bridge a	one-horse	cab	came	into	the	road	from	a	side-street	and	turned	in	their direction.	"Come	on,"	said	Peter.	"Anything	is	better	than	this	infernal	walk	over this	 pavé	always.	Let's	hop	in."

They	stopped	the	man,	who	asked	where	to	drive	to.

"Let's	go	to	the	Bretagne	first	and	get	a	drink,"	said	Pennell.

"Right,"	said	Peter—"any	old	thing.	Hôtel	de	la	Bretagne,"	he	called	to	the driver.

They	set	off	at	some	sort	of	a	pace,	and	Pennell	leaned	back	with	a	laugh.	"It's	a funny	old	world,	Graham,"	he	said.	"One	does	get	fed-up	at	times.	Why	sitting	in a	funeral	show	like	this	cab	and	having	a	drink	in	a	second-rate	pub	should	be any	amusement,	I	don't	know.	But	it	is.	You're	infectious,	my	boy.	I	begin	to	feel like	a	rag	myself.	What	shall	we	do?"

"The	great	thing,"	said	Peter	judiciously,	"is	not	to	know	what	one	is	going	to	do, but	just	to	take	anything	that	comes	along.	I	remember	at	the	'Varsity	one	never set	out	to	rag	anything	definitely.	You	went	out	and	you	saw	a	bobby	and	you took	his	hat,	let	us	say.	You	cleared,	and	he	after	you.	Anything	might	happen then."

"I	should	think	so,"	said	Pennell.

"I	remember	once	walking	home	with	a	couple	of	men,	and	one	of	them suggested	dousing	all	the	street	lamps	in	the	road,	which	was	a	residential	one

leading	into	town.	There	wasn't	anything	in	it,	but	we	did	it.	One	man	put	his back	against	a	post,	while	the	second	went	on	to	the	next	post.	Then	the	third man	mounted	the	first	man's	back,	shoved	out	the	light,	jumped	clear,	and	ran	on past	the	next	lamp-post	to	the	third.	The	first	man	jumped	on	No.	2's	back	and doused	his	lamp,	and	so	on.	We	did	the	street	in	a	few	minutes,	and	then	a constable	came	into	it	at	the	top.	He	probably	thought	he	was	drunk,	then	he spotted	lights	going	out,	and	like	an	ass	he	blew	his	whistle.	We	were	round	a corner	in	no	time,	and	then	turned	and	ran	back	to	see	if	we	could	offer assistance!"

"Some	gag!"	chuckled	Pennell;	"but	I	hope	you	won't	go	on	that	sort	of	racket to-night.	It	would	be	a	little	more	serious	if	we	were	caught….	Also,	these blighted	gendarmes	would	probably	start	firing,	or	some	other	damned	thing."

"They	would,"	said	Peter;	"besides,	that	doesn't	appeal	to	me	now.	I'm	getting too	old,	or	else	my	tastes	have	become	depraved."

The	one-horse	cab	stopped	with	a	jerk.	"Hop	out,"	said	Peter.	He	settled	the score,	and	the	two	of	them	entered	the	hotel	and	passed	through	into	the	private bar.

"What	is	it	to	be?"	demanded	Pennell.

"Cocktails	to-day,	old	son,"	said	Peter;	"I	want	bucking	up.	What	do	you	say	to martinis?"

The	other	agreed,	and	they	moved	over	to	the	bar.	A	monstrously	fat	woman stood	behind	it,	like	some	bloated	spider,	and	a	thin,	weedy-looking	girl	assisted her.	A	couple	of	men	were	already	there.	It	was	too	early	for	official	drinks,	but the	Bretagne	knew	no	law.

They	ordered	their	drinks,	and	stood	there	while	madame	compounded	them	and put	in	the	cherries.	Another	man	came	in,	and	Peter	recognised	the	Australian Ferrars,	whom	he	had	met	before.	He	introduced	Pennell	and	called	for	another martini.

"So	you	frequent	this	poison-shop,	do	you?"	said	Ferrars.

"Not	much,"	laughed	Peter,	"but	it's	convenient."

"It	is,	and	it's	a	good	sign	when	a	man	like	you	wants	a	drink.	I'd	sooner	listen	to your	sermons	any	day	than	some	chaps'	I	know."

"Subject	barred	here,"	said	Pennell.	"But	here's	the	very	best	to	you, Graham,	for	all	that."

"Same	here,"	said	Ferrars,	and	put	down	his	empty	glass.

The	talk	became	general.	There	was	nothing	whatever	in	it—mild	chaffing,	a yarn	or	two,	a	guarded	description	by	Peter	of	his	motor	drive	from	Abbeville, and	then	more	drinks.	And	so	on.	The	atmosphere	was	warm	and	genial,	but Peter	wondered	inwardly	why	he	liked	it,	and	he	did	not	like	it	so	much	that Pennell's	"Well,	what	about	it?	Let's	go	on,	Graham,	shall	we?"	found	him unready.	The	two	said	a	general	good-bye,	promised	madame	to	look	in	again, and	sauntered	out.

They	crossed	the	square	in	front	of	Travalini's,	lingered	at	the	flower-stalls, refused	the	girls'	pressure	to	buy,	and	strolled	on.	"I'm	sick	of	Travalini's,"	said Pennell.	"Don't	let's	go	in	there."

"So	am	I,"	said	Peter.	"Let's	stroll	down	towards	the	sea."

They	turned	down	a	side-street,	and	stood	for	a	few	minutes	looking	into	a picture	and	book	shop.	At	that	moment	quick	footsteps	sounded	on	the pavement,	and	Pennell	glanced	round.

Two	girls	passed	them,	obviously	sisters.	They	were	not	flashily	dressed	exactly, but	there	was	something	in	their	furs	and	their	high-heeled,	high-laced	boots	that told	its	own	story.	"By	Jove,	that's	a	pretty	girl!"	exclaimed	Pennell;	"let's	follow them."

Peter	laughed;	he	was	reckless,	but	not	utterly	so.	"If	you	like,"	he	said.	"I'm	on for	any	rag.	We'll	take	them	for	a	drink,	but	I	stop	at	that,	mind,	Pen."

"Sure	thing,"	said	Pennell.	"But	come	on;	we'll	miss	them."

They	set	out	after	the	girls,	who,	after	one	glance	back,	walked	on	as	if	they	did not	know	they	were	being	followed.	But	they	walked	slowly,	and	it	was	easy	for the	two	men	to	catch	them	up.

Peter	slackened	a	few	paces	behind.	"Look	here,	Pen,"	he	said,	"what	the	deuce are	we	going	to	do?	They'll	expect	more	than	a	drink,	you	know."

"Oh	no,	they	won't,	not	so	early	as	this.	It's	all	in	the	way	of	business	to	them, too.	Let's	pass	them	first,"	he	suggested,	"and	then	slacken	down	and	wait	for them	to	speak."

Peter	acquiesced,	feeling	rather	more	than	an	ass,	but	the	drinks	had	gone slightly	to	his	head.	They	executed	their	share	of	the	maneuver,	Pennell	looking at	the	girls	and	smiling	as	he	did	so.	But	the	two	quickened	their	pace	and	passed the	officers	without	a	word.

"If	you	ask	me,	this	is	damned	silly,"	said	Peter.	"Let's	chuck	it."

"No,	no;	wait	a	bit,"	said	Pennell	excitedly.	"You'll	see	what	they'll	do.	It's	really an	amusing	study	in	human	nature.	Look!	I	told	you	so.	They	live	there."

The	girls	had	crossed	the	street,	and	were	entering	a	house.	One	of	them unlocked	the	door,	and	they	both	disappeared.	"There,"	said	Peter,	"that	finishes it.	We've	lost	them."

"Have	we?"	said	his	companion.	"Come	on	over."

They	crossed	the	street	and	walked	up	to	the	door.	It	was	open	and	perhaps	a foot	ajar.	Pennell	pushed	it	wide	and	walked	in.	"Come	on,"	he	said	again.	Peter followed	reluctantly,	but	curious.	He	was	seeing	a	new	side	of	life,	he	thought grimly.

Before	them	a	flight	of	stairs	led	straight	up	to	a	landing,	but	there	was	no	sign of	the	girls.	"What's	next?"	demanded	Peter.	"We'll	be	fired	out	in	two	twos	if nothing	worse	happens.	Suppose	they're	decent	girls	after	all;	what	would	you say?"

"I'd	ask	if	Mlle.	Lucienne	lived	here,"	said	Pennell,	"and	apologise	profusely when	I	found	she	didn't.	But	you	can't	make	a	mistake	in	this	street,	Graham.	I'm going	up.	It's	the	obvious	thing,	and	probably	what	they	wanted.	Coming?"

He	set	off	to	mount	the	stairs,	and	Peter,	reassured,	followed	him,	at	a	few	paces.

When	he	reached	the	top,	Pennell	was	already	entering	an	open	door.

"How	do	you	do,	ma	chérie?"	said	one	of	the	girls,	smiling,	and	holding	out	a hand.

Peter	looked	round	curiously.	The	room	was	fairly	decently	furnished	in	a foreign	middle-class	fashion,	half	bedroom,	half	sitting-room.	One	of	the	girls sat	on	the	arm	of	a	big	chair,	the	other	was	greeting	his	friend.	She	was	the	one he	had	fancied,	but	a	quick	glance	attracted	Peter	to	the	other	and	elder.	He	was in	for	it	now,	and	he	was	determined	to	play	up.	He	crossed	the	floor,	and	smiled down	at	the	girl	on	the	arm	of	the	chair.

"So	you	'ave	come,"	she	said	in	broken	English.	"I	told	Lucienne	that	you	would not."

"Lucienne!"	exclaimed	Peter,	and	looked	back	at	Pennell.

That	traitor	laughed,	and	seated	himself	on	the	edge	of	the	bed,	drawing	the other	girl	to	him.	"I'm	awfully	sorry,	Graham,"	he	said;	"but	I	couldn't	help	it.

You	wanted	to	see	life,	and	you'd	have	shied	off	if	I	hadn't	played	a	game.	I	do just	know	this	little	girl,	and	jolly	nice	she	is	too.	Give	me	a	kiss,	Lulu."

The	girl	obeyed,	her	eyes	sparkling.	"It's	not	proper	before	monsieur,"	she	said.

"'E	is—how	do	you	say?—shocked?"

She	seated	herself	on	Pennell's	knee,	and,	putting	an	arm	round	his	neck,	kissed him	again,	looking	across	at	Peter	mischievously.	"We	show	'im	French	kiss,"

she	added	to	Pennell,	and	pouted	out	her	lips	to	his.

"Well,	now	you	'ave	come,	what	do	you	want?"	demanded	the	girl	on	the	arm	of Peter's	chair.	"Sit	down,"	she	said	imperiously,	patting	the	seat,	"and	talk	to	me."

Peter	laughed	more	lightly	than	he	felt.	"Well,	I	want	a	drink,"	he	said,	at random.	"Pen,"	he	called	across	the	room,	"what	about	that	drink?"	The	girl	by him	reached	over	and	touched	a	bell.	As	she	did	so,	Peter	saw	the	curls	that clustered	on	her	neck	and	caught	the	perfume	of	her	hair.	It	was	penetrating	and peculiar,	but	not	distasteful,	and	it	did	all	that	it	was	meant	to	do.	He	bent,	and kissed	the	back	of	her	neck,	still	marvelling	at	himself.

She	straightened	herself,	smiling.	"That	is	better.	You	aren't	so	cold	as	you pretended,	chérie.	Now	kiss	me	properly,"	and	she	held	up	her	face.

Peter	kissed	her	lips.	Before	he	knew	it,	a	pair	of	arms	were	thrown	about	his neck,	and	he	was	being	half-suffocated	with	kisses.	He	tore	himself	away, disgusted	and	ashamed.

"No!"	he	cried	sharply,	but	knowing	that	it	was	too	late.

The	girl	threw	herself	back,	laughing	merrily,	"Oh,	you	are	funny!"	she	said.

"Lucienne,	take	your	boy	away;	I	want	to	talk	to	mine."

Before	he	could	think	of	a	remonstrance,	it	was	done.	Pennell	and	the	other	girl got	up	from	the	bed	where	they	had	been	whispering	together,	and	left	the	room.

"Pennell!"	called	Peter,	too	late	again,	jumping	up.	The	girl	ran	round	him, pushed	the	door	to,	locked	it,	and	dropped	the	key	down	the	neck	of	her	dress.

"Voila!"	she	said	gaily.

There	came	a	knock	on	the	door.	"Non,	non!"	she	cried	in	French.	"Take	the wine	to	Mlle.	Lucienne;	I	am	busy."

Peter	walked	across	the	room	to	her.	"Give	me	the	key,"	he	said,	holding	out	his hand,	and	changing	his	tactics.	"Please	do.	I	won't	go	till	my	friend	comes	back.

I	promise."

The	girl	looked	at	him.	"You	promise?	But	you	will	'ave	to	find	it."

He	smiled	and	nodded,	and	she	walked	deliberately	to	the	bed,	undid	the	front	of her	costume,	and	slipped	it	off.	Bare	necked	and	armed,	she	turned	to	him, holding	open	the	front	of	her	chemise.	"Down	there,"	she	said.

It	was	a	strange	moment	and	a	strange	thing,	but	a	curious	courage	came	back	to Peter	in	that	second.	Without	hesitation,	he	put	his	hand	down	and	sought	for	the key	against	her	warm	body.	He	found	it,	and	help	it	up,	smiling.	Then	he	moved to	the	door,	pushed	the	key	in	the	keyhole,	and	turned	again	to	the	girl.	"There!"

he	said	simply.

With	a	gesture	of	abandon,	she	threw	herself	on	the	bed,	propping	her	cheek	on her	hand	and	staring	at	him.	He	sat	down	where	Pennell	had	sat,	but	made	no attempt	to	touch	her,	leaning,	instead,	back	and	away	against	the	iron	bed-post.

She	pulled	up	her	knees,	flung	her	arms	back,	and	laughed.	"And	now, monsieur?"	she	said.

Peter	had	never	felt	so	cool	in	his	life.	His	thoughts	raced,	but	steadily,	as	if	he had	dived	into	cold,	clear	water.	He	smiled	again,	unhesitatingly,	but	sadly.

"Dear,"	he	said	deliberately,	"listen	to	me.	I	have	cheated	you	by	coming	here	to-day,	though	you	shan't	suffer	for	it.	I	did	not	want	anything,	and	I	don't	now.	But I'm	glad	I've	come,	even	though	you	do	not	understand.	I	don't	want	to	do	a	bit what	my	friend	is	doing.	I	don't	know	why,	but	I	don't.	I'm	engaged	to	a	girl	in England,	but	it's	not	because	of	that.	I'm	a	chaplain	too—a	curé,	you	know—in the	English	Army;	but	it's	not	because	of	that."

"Protestant?"	demanded	the	girl	on	the	bed.

He	nodded.	"Ah,	well,"	she	said,	"the	Protestant	ministers	have	wives.	They	are men;	it	is	different	with	priests.	If	your	fiancée	is	wise,	she	wouldn't	mind	if	you love	me	a	little.	She	is	in	England;	I	am	here—is	it	not	so?	You	love	me	now; again,	perhaps,	once	or	twice.	Then	it	is	finished.	You	do	not	tell	your	fiancée and	she	does	not	know.	It	is	no	matter.	Come	on,	chérie!"

She	held	out	her	hands	and	threw	her	head	back	on	the	pillow.

Peter	smiled	again.	"You	do	not	understand,"	he	said.	"And	nor	do	I,	but I	must	be	different	from	some	men.	I	do	not	want	to."

"Ah,	well,"	she	exclaimed	brightly,	sitting	up,	"another	time!	Give	me	my	dress, monsieur	le	curé."

He	got	up	and	handed	it	to	her.	"Tell	me,"	he	said,	"do	you	like	this	sort	of	life?"

She	shrugged	her	white	shoulders	indifferently.	"Sometimes,"	she	said

—"sometimes	not.	There	are	good	boys	and	bad	boys.	Some	are	rough,	cruel, mean;	some	are	kind,	and	remember	that	it	costs	much	to	live	these	days,	and one	must	dress	nicely.	See,"	she	said	deliberately,	showing	him,	"it	is	lace,	fine lace;	I	pay	fifty	francs	in	Paris!"

"I	will	give	you	that,"	said	Peter,	and	he	placed	the	note	on	the	bed.

She	stared	at	it	and	at	him.	"Oh,	I	love	you!"	she	cried.	"You	are	kind!

Ah,	now,	if	I	could	but	love	you	always!"

"Always?"	he	demanded.

"Yes,	always,	always,	while	you	are	here,	in	Le	Havre.	I	would	have	no	other boy	but	you.	Ah,	if	you	would!	You	do	not	know	how	one	tires	of	the	music-hall, the	drinks,	the	smiles!	I	would	do	just	all	you	please—be	gay,	be	solemn,	talk,	be silent,	just	as	you	please!	Oh,	if	you	would!"

Half	in	and	half	out	of	her	dress,	she	stood	there,	pleading.	Peter	looked	closely at	the	little	face	with	its	rouge	and	powder.

"You	hate	that!"	she	exclaimed,	with	quick	intuition.	"See,	it	is	gone.	I	use	it	no more,	only	a	leetle,	leetle,	for	the	night."	And	she	ran	across	to	the	basin,	dipped a	little	sponge	in	water,	passed	it	over	her	face,	and	turned	to	him	triumphantly.

Peter	sighed.	"Little	girl,"	he	said	sadly,	hardly	knowing	that	he	spoke.

"I	cannot	save	myself:	how	can	I	save	you?"

"Pouf!"	she	cried.	"Save!	What	do	you	mean?"	She	drew	herself	up	with	an absurd	gesture.	"You	think	me	a	bad	girl?	No,	I	am	not	bad;	I	go	to	church.	Le bon	Dieu	made	us	as	we	are;	it	is	nécessaire."

They	stood	before	each	other,	a	strange	pair,	the	product	of	a	strange	age.	God knows	what	the	angels	made	of	it.	But	at	any	rate	Peter	was	honest.	He	thought of	Julie,	and	he	would	not	cast	a	stone.

There	came	a	light	knock	at	the	door.	The	girl	disregarded	it,	and	ran	to	him.

"You	will	come	again?"	she	said	in	low	tones.	"Promise	me	that	you	will!	I	will not	ask	you	for	anything;	you	can	do	as	you	please;	but	come	again!	Do	come again!"

Peter	passed	his	hand	over	her	hair.	"I	will	come	if	I	can,"	he	said;	"but	the	Lord knows	why."

The	knock	came	again,	a	little	louder.	The	girl	smiled	and	held	her	face	up.	"Kiss me,"	she	demanded.

He	complied,	and	she	darted	away,	fumbling	with	her	dress.	"I	come,"	she called,	and	opened	the	door.	Lucienne	and	Pennell	came	in,	and	the	two	men exchanged	glances.	Then	Pennell	looked	away.	Lucienne	glanced	at	them	and shrugged	her	shoulders.	"Come,	Graham,"	said	Pennell;	"let's	get	out!	Good-bye, you	two."

The	pair	of	them	went	down	and	out	in	silence.	No	one	had	seen	them	come,	and there	was	no	one	to	see	them	go.	Peter	glanced	at	the	number	and	made	a	mental note	of	it,	and	they	set	off	down	the	street.

Presently	Pennell	laughed,	"I	played	you	a	dirty	trick,	Graham,"	he	said,

"I'm	sorry."

"You	needn't	be,"	said	Peter;	"I'm	very	glad	I	went."

"Why?"	said	Pennell	curiously,	glancing	sideways	at	him.	"You	 are	a	queer fellow,	Graham."	But	there	was	a	note	of	relief	in	his	tone.

Peter	said	nothing,	but	walked	on.	"Where	next?"	demanded	Pennell.

"It	looks	as	if	you	are	directing	this	outfit,"	said	Peter;	"I'm	in	your	hands."

"All	right,"	said	Pennell;	"I	know."

They	took	a	street	running	parallel	to	the	docks,	and	entered	an	American	bar.

Peter	glanced	round	curiously.	"I've	never	been	here	before,"	he	said.

"Probably	not,"	said	Pennell.	"It's	not	much	at	this	time	of	the	year,	but	jolly	cool in	the	summer.	And	you	can	get	first-class	cocktails.	I	want	something	now; what's	yours?"

"I'll	leave	it	to	you,"	said	Peter.

He	sat	down	at	a	little	table	rather	in	the	corner	and	lit	a	cigarette.	The	place	was well	lighted,	and	by	means	of	mirrors,	coloured-glass	ornaments,	paper decorations,	and	a	few	palms,	it	looked	in	its	own	way	smart.	Two	or	three officers	were	drinking	at	the	bar,	sitting	on	high	stools,	and	Pennell	went	up	to give	his	order.	He	brought	two	glasses	to	Peter's	table	and	sat	down.	"What	fools we	are,	padre!"	he	said.	"I	sometimes	think	that	the	man	who	gets	simply	and definitely	tight	when	he	feels	he	wants	a	breather	is	wiser	than	most	of	us.	We drink	till	we're	excited,	and	then	we	drink	to	get	over	it.	And	I	suppose	the	devil sits	and	grins.	Well,	it's	a	weary	world,	and	there	isn't	any	good	road	out	of	it.	I sometimes	wish	I'd	stopped	a	bullet	earlier	on	in	the	day.	And	yet	I	don't	know.

We	do	get	some	excitement.	Let's	go	to	a	music-hall	to-night."

"What	about	dinner?"

"Oh,	get	a	quiet	one	in	a	decent	hotel.	I'll	have	to	clear	out	at	half-time	if	you don't	mind."

"Not	a	bit,"	said	Peter.	"Half	will	be	enough	for	me,	I	think.	But	let's	have	dinner before	we've	had	more	of	these	things."

The	bar	was	filling	up.	A	few	girls	came	and	went.	Pennell	nodded	to	a	man	or two,	and	finished	his	glass.	And	they	went	off	to	dinner.

The	music-hall	was	not	much	of	a	show,	but	it	glittered,	and	people	obviously enjoyed	it.	Peter	watched	the	audience	as	much	as	the	stage.	Quite	respectable French	families	were	there,	and	there	was	nothing	done	that	might	not	have	been done	on	an	English	stage—perhaps	less,	but	the	words	were	different.	The women	as	well	as	the	men	screamed	with	laughter,	flushed	of	face,	but	an	old fellow,	with	his	wife	and	daughter,	obviously	from	the	country,	sat	as	stiffly	as an	English	farmer	through	it	all.	The	daughter	glanced	once	at	the	two	officers, but	then	looked	away;	she	was	well	brought	up.	A	half-caste	Algerian,	probably, came	on	and	danced	really	extraordinarily	well,	and	a	negro	from	the	States, equally	ready	in	French	and	English,	sang	songs	which	the	audience	demanded.

He	was	entirely	master,	however,	and,	conscious	of	his	power,	used	it.	No	one	in the	place	seemed	to	have	heard	of	the	colour-bar,	except	a	couple	of	Americans, who	got	up	and	walked	out	when	the	comedian	clasped	a	white	girl	round	the waist	in	one	of	his	songs.	The	negro	made	some	remark	that	Peter	couldn't	catch, and	the	place	shook	with	laughter.

At	half-time	everyone	flocked	into	a	queer	kind	of	semi-underground	hall	whose walls	were	painted	to	represent	a	cave,	dingy	cork	festoons	and	"rocks"	adding to	the	illusion.	Here,	at	long	tables,	everyone	drank	innocuous	French	beer,	that was	really	quite	cool	and	good.	It	was	rather	like	part	of	an	English	bank	holiday.

Everybody	spoke	to	everybody	else,	and	there	were	no	classes	and	distinctions.

You	could	only	get	one	glass	of	beer,	for	the	simple	reason	that	there	were	too many	drinking	and	too	few	supplying	the	drinks	for	more	in	the	time.

"I	must	go,"	said	Pennell,	"but	don't	you	bother	to	come."

"Oh	yes,	I	will,"	said	Peter,	and	they	got	up	together.

In	the	entrance-hall,	however,	a	girl	was	apparently	waiting	for	someone,	and	as they	passed	Peter	recognised	her.	"Louise!"	he	exclaimed.

She	smiled	and	held	out	her	hand.	Peter	took	it,	and	Pennell	after	him.

"Do	you	go	now?"	she	asked	them.	"The	concert	is	not	half	finished."

"I've	got	to	get	back	to	work,"	said	Pennell,	"worse	luck.	It	is	la	guerre,	you know!"

"Poor	boy!"	said	she	gaily.	"And	you?"	turning	to	Peter.

Moved	by	an	impulse,	he	shook	his	head.	"No,"	he	said,	"I	was	only	seeing	him home."

"Bien!	See	me	home	instead,	then,"	said	Louise.

"Nothing	doing,"	said	Peter,	using	a	familiar	phrase.

She	laughed.	"Bah!	cannot	a	girl	have	friends	without	that,	eh?	You	have	a fiancée,	'ave	you	not?	Oh	yes,	I	remember—I	remember	very	well.	Come!	I	have done	for	to-day;	I	am	tired.	I	will	make	you	some	coffee,	and	we	shall	talk.	Is	it not	so?"

Peter	looked	at	Pennell.	"Do	you	mind,	Pen?"	he	asked.	"I'd	rather	like	to."

"Not	a	scrap,"	said	the	other	cheerfully;	"wish	I	could	come	too.	Ask	me	another day,	Louise,	will	you?"

She	regarded	him	with	her	head	a	little	on	one	side.	"I	do	not	know,"	she	said.	"I do	not	think	you	would	talk	with	me	as	he	will.	You	like	what	you	can	get	from the	girls	of	France	now;	but	after,	no	more.	Monsieur,	'e	is	different.	He	want	not quite	the	same.	Oh,	I	know!	Allons."

Pennell	shrugged	his	shoulders.	"One	for	me,"	he	said.	"Well,	good-night.

I	hope	you	both	enjoy	yourselves."

In	five	minutes	Peter	and	Louise	were	walking	together	down	the	street.	A	few passers-by	glanced	at	them,	or	especially	at	her,	but	she	took	no	notice,	and Peter,	in	a	little,	felt	the	strangeness	of	it	all	much	less.	He	deliberately	crossed once	or	twice	to	get	between	her	and	the	road,	as	he	would	have	done	with	a lady,	and	moved	slightly	in	front	of	her	when	they	encountered	two	drunken men.	She	chatted	about	nothing	in	particular,	and	Peter	thought	to	himself	that	he

might	almost	have	been	escorting	Hilda	home.	But	if	Hilda	had	seen	him!

She	ushered	him	into	her	flat.	It	was	cosy	and	nicely	furnished,	very	different from	that	of	the	afternoon.	A	photograph	or	two	stood	about	in	silver	frames,	a few	easy-chairs,	a	little	table,	a	bookshelf,	and	a	cupboard.	A	fire	was	alight	in the	grate;	Louise	knelt	down	and	poked	it	into	a	flame.

"You	shall	have	French	coffee,"	she	said.	"And	I	have	even	lait	for	you."	She	put a	copper	kettle	on	the	fire,	and	busied	herself	with	cups	and	saucers.	These	she arranged	on	the	little	table,	and	drew	it	near	the	fire.	Then	she	offered	him	a cigarette	from	a	gold	case,	and	took	one	herself.	"Ah!"	she	said,	sinking	back into	a	chair.	"Now	we	are,	as	you	say,	comfy,	is	it	not	so?	We	can	talk.	Tell	me how	you	like	la	France,	and	what	you	do."

Peter	tried,	but	failed	rather	miserably,	and	the	shrewd	French	girl	noticed	it easily	enough.	She	all	but	interrupted	him	as	he	talked	of	Abbeville	and	the	raid.

"Mon	ami,"	she	said,	"you	have	something	on	your	mind.	You	do	not	want	to talk	of	these	things.	Tell	me."

Peter	looked	into	the	kindly	keen	eyes.	"You	are	right,	Louise,"	he	said.

"This	is	a	day	of	trouble	for	me."

She	nodded.	"Tell	me,"	she	said	again.	"But	first,	what	is	your	name,	mon	ami?

It	is	hard	to	talk	if	one	does	not	know	even	the	name."

He	hardly	hesitated.	It	seemed	natural	to	say	it.	"Peter,"	he	said.

She	smiled,	rolling	the	"r."	"Peterr.	Well,	Peterr,	go	on."

"I'll	tell	you	about	to-day	first,"	he	said,	and,	once	launched,	did	so	easily.	He told	the	little	story	well,	and	presently	forgot	the	strange	surroundings.	It	was	all but	a	confession,	and	surely	one	was	never	more	strangely	made.	And	from	the story	he	spoke	of	Julie,	but	concealed	her	identity,	and	then	he	spoke	of	God.

Louise	hardly	said	a	word.	She	poured	out	coffee	in	the	middle,	but	that	was	all.

At	last	he	finished.

"Louise,"	he	said,	"it	comes	to	this:	I've	nothing	left	but	Julie.	It	was	she restrained	me	this	afternoon,	I	think.	I'm	mad	for	her;	I	want	her	and	nothing else.	But	with	her,	somehow,	I	lose	everything	else	I	possess	or	ever	thought	I possessed."	And	he	stopped	abruptly,	for	she	did	not	know	his	business	in	life,

and	he	had	almost	given	it	away.

When	he	had	finished	she	slipped	a	hand	into	his,	and	said	no	word.	Suddenly she	looked	up.	"Peterr,	mon	ami,"	she	said,	"listen	to	me.	I	will	tell	you	the	story of	Louise,	of	me.	My	father,	he	lived—oh,	it	matters	not;	but	he	had	some money,	he	was	not	poor.	I	went	to	a	good	school,	and	I	came	home	for	the holidays.	I	had	one	sister	older	than	me.	Presently	I	grew	up;	I	learnt	much;	I noticed.	I	saw	there	were	terrible	things,	chez	nous.	My	mother	did	not	care,	but I—I	cared.	I	was	mad.	I	spoke	to	my	sister:	it	was	no	good.	I	spoke	to	my	father, and,	truly,	I	thought	he	would	kill	me.	He	beat	me—ah,	terrible—and	I	ran	from the	house.	I	wept	under	the	hedges:	I	said	I	would	no	more	go	'ome.	I	come	to	a big	city.	I	found	work	in	a	big	shop—much	work,	little	money—ah,	how	little!

Then	I	met	a	friend:	he	persuade	me,	at	last	he	keep	me—two	months,	three,	or more;	then	comes	the	war.	He	is	an	officer,	and	he	goes.	We	kiss,	we	part—oui, he	love	me,	that	officer.	I	pray	for	him:	I	think	I	nevair	leave	the	church;	but	it	is no	good.	He	is	dead.	Then	I	curse	le	bon	Dieu.	They	know	me	in	that	place:	I can	do	nothing	unless	I	will	go	to	an	'otel—to	be	for	the	officers,	you understand?	I	say,	Non.	I	sell	my	things	and	I	come	here.	Here	I	do	well—you understand?	I	am	careful;	I	have	now	my	home.	But	this	is	what	I	tell	you, Peterr:	one	does	wrong	to	curse	le	bon	Dieu.	He	is	wise—ah,	how	wise!—it	is not	for	me	to	say.	And	good—ah,	Jesu!	how	good!	You	think	I	do	not	know;	I, how	should	I	know?	But	I	know.	I	do	not	understand.	For	me,	I	am	caught;	I	am like	the	bird	in	the	cage.	I	cannot	get	out.	So	I	smile,	I	laugh—and	I	wait."

She	ceased.	Peter	was	strangely	moved,	and	he	pressed	the	hand	he	held	almost fiercely.	The	tragedy	of	her	life	seemed	so	great	that	he	hardly	dare	speak	of	his own.	But:	"What	has	it	to	do	with	me?"	he	demanded.

She	gave	a	little	laugh.	"'Ow	should	I	say?"	she	said.	"But	you	think	God	not remember	you,	and,	Peterr,	He	remember	all	the	time."

"And	Julie?"	quizzed	Peter	after	a	moment.

Louise	shrugged	her	shoulders.	"This	love,"	she	said,	"it	is	one	great	thing.	For us	women	it	is	perhaps	the	only	great	thing,	though	your	English	women	are blind,	are	dead,	they	do	not	see.	Julie,	she	is	as	us,	I	think.	She	is	French	inside.

La	pauvre	petite,	she	is	French	in	the	heart."

"Well?"	demanded	Peter	again.

"C'est	tout,	mon	ami.	But	I	am	sorry	for	Julie."

"Louise,"	said	Peter	impulsively,	"you're	better	than	I—a	thousand	times.	I	don't know	how	to	thank	you."	And	he	lifted	her	hand	to	his	lips.

He	hardly	touched	it.	She	sprang	up,	withdrawing	it.	"Ah,	non,	non,"	she	cried.

"You	must	not.	You	forget.	It	is	easy	for	you,	for	you	are	good—yes,	so	good.

You	think	I	did	not	notice	in	the	street,	but	I	see.	You	treat	me	like	a	lady,	and now	you	kiss	my	hand,	the	hand	of	the	girl	of	the	street….	Non,	non!"	she protested	vehemently,	her	eyes	alight.	"I	would	kiss	your	feet!"

Outside,	in	the	darkened	street,	Peter	walked	slowly	home.	At	the	gate	of	the camp	he	met	Arnold,	returning	from	a	visit	to	another	mess.	"Hullo!"	he	called to	Peter,	"and	where	have	you	been?"

Peter	looked	at	him	for	a	moment	without	replying.	" I'm	not	sure,	but	seeing	for the	first	time	a	little	of	what	Christ	saw,	Arnold,	I	think,"	he	said	at	last,	with	a catch	in	his	voice.





CHAPTER	IV

Looking	back	on	them	afterwards,	Peter	saw	the	months	that	followed	as	a	time of	waiting	between	two	periods	of	stress.	Not,	of	course,	that	anyone	can	ever stand	still,	for	even	if	one	does	but	sit	by	a	fire	and	warm	one's	hands,	things happen,	and	one	is	imperceptibly	led	forward.	It	was	so	in	this	case,	but,	not unnaturally,	Graham	hardly	noticed	in	what	way	his	mind	was	moving.	He	had been	through	a	period	of	storm,	and	he	had	to	a	certain	extent	emerged	from	it.

The	men	he	had	met,	and	above	all	Julie,	had	been	responsible	for	the	opening	of his	eyes	to	facts	that	he	had	before	passed	over,	and	it	was	entirely	to	his	credit that	he	would	not	refuse	to	accept	them	and	act	upon	them.	But	once	he	had resolved	to	do	so	things,	as	it	were,	slowed	down.	He	went	about	his	work	in	a new	spirit,	the	spirit	not	of	the	teacher,	but	of	the	learner,	and	ever	since	his	talk with	Louise	he	thought—or	tried	to	think—more	of	what	love	might	mean	to Julie	than	to	himself.	The	result	was	a	curious	change	in	their	relations,	of	which the	girl	was	more	immediately	and	continually	conscious	than	Peter.	She	puzzled over	it,	but	could	not	get	the	clue,	and	her	quest	irritated	her.	Peter	had	always been	the	least	little	bit	nervous	in	her	presence.	She	had	known	that	he	never knew	what	she	would	do	or	say	next,	and	her	knowledge	had	amused	and	carried her	away.	But	now	he	was	so	self-possessed.	Very	friendly	they	were,	and	they met	often—in	the	ward	for	a	few	sentences	that	meant	much	to	each	of	them; down	town	by	arrangement	in	a	cafe,	or	once	or	twice	for	dinner;	and	once	for	a day	in	the	country,	though	not	alone;	and	he	was	always	the	same.	Sometimes, on	night	duty,	she	would	grope	for	an	adjective	to	fit	him,	and	could	only	think of	"tender."	He	was	that.	And	she	hated	it,	or	all	but	hated	it.	She	did	not	want tenderness	from	him,	for	it	seemed	to	her	that	tenderness	meant	that	he	was,	as	it were,	standing	aloof	from	her,	considering,	helping	when	he	could.	She demanded	the	fierce	rush	of	passion	with	which	he	would	seize	and	shrine	her	in the	centre	of	his	heart,	deaf	to	her	entreaties,	careless	of	her	pain.	She	would	love then,	she	thought,	and	sometimes,	going	to	the	window	of	the	ward	and	staring out	over	the	harbour	at	the	twinkling	lights,	she	would	bite	her	lip	with	the	pain

of	it.	He	had	thought	she	dismissed	love	lightly	when	she	called	it	animal passion.	Good	God,	if	he	only	knew!…

Peter,	for	his	part,	did	not	realise	so	completely	the	change	that	had	come	over him.	For	one	thing,	he	saw	himself	all	the	time,	and	she	did	not.	She	did	not	see him	when	he	lay	on	his	bed	in	a	tense	agony	of	desire	for	her.	She	did	not	see him	when	life	looked	like	a	tumbled	heap	of	ruins	to	him	and	she	smiled	beyond.

She	all	but	only	saw	him	when	he	was	staring	at	the	images	that	had	been presented	to	him	during	the	past	months,	or	hearing	in	imagination	Louise's quaintly	accepted	English	and	her	quick	and	vivid	"La	pauvre	petite!"

For	it	was	Louise,	curiously	enough,	who	affected	him	most	in	these	days.	A friendship	sprang	up	between	them	of	which	no	one	knew.	Pennell	and	Donovan, with	whom	he	went	everywhere,	did	not	speak	of	it	either	to	him	or	to	one another,	with	that	real	chivalry	that	is	in	most	men,	but	if	they	had	they	would have	blundered,	misunderstanding.	Arnold,	of	whom	Peter	saw	a	good	deal,	did not	know,	or,	if	he	knew,	Peter	never	knew	that	he	knew.	Julie,	who	was	well aware	of	his	friendship	with	the	two	first	men,	knew	that	he	saw	French	girls, and,	indeed,	openly	chaffed	him	about	it.	But	under	her	chaff	was	an	anxiety, typical	of	her.	She	did	not	know	how	far	he	went	in	their	company,	and	she would	have	given	anything	to	know.	She	guessed	that,	despite	everything,	he	had had	no	physical	relationship	with	any	one	of	them,	and	she	almost	wished	it might	be	otherwise.	She	knew	well	that	if	he	fell	to	them,	he	would	the	more readily	turn	to	her.	There	was	a	strength	about	him	now	that	she	dreaded.

Whatever	Louise	thought	she	kept	wonderfully	hidden.	He	took	her	out	to	dinner in	quiet	places,	and	she	would	take	him	home	to	coffee,	and	they	would	chat, and	there	was	an	end.	She	was	seemingly	well	content.	She	did	her	business,	and they	would	even	speak	of	it.	"I	cannot	come	to-night,	mon	ami,"	she	would	say;

"I	am	busy."	She	would	nod	to	him	as	she	passed	out	of	the	restaurant	with someone	else,	and	he	would	smile	back	at	her.	Nor	did	he	ever	remonstrate	or urge	her	to	change	her	ways.	And	she	knew	why.	He	had	no	key	with	which	to open	her	cage.

Once,	truly,	he	attempted	it,	and	it	was	she	who	refused	the	glittering	thing.	He rarely	came	uninvited	to	her	flat,	for	obvious	reasons;	but	one	night	she	heard him	on	the	stairs	as	she	got	ready	for	bed.	He	was	walking	unsteadily,	and	she thought	at	first	that	he	had	been	drinking.	She	opened	to	him	with	the carelessness	her	life	had	taught	her,	her	costume	off,	and	her	black	hair	all	about

her	shoulders.	"Go	in	and	wait,	Peterr,"	she	said;	"I	come."

She	had	slipped	on	a	coloured	silk	wrap,	and	gone	in	to	the	sitting-room	to	find him	pacing	up	and	down.	She	smiled.	"Sit	down,	mon	ami,"	she	said;	"I	will make	the	coffee.	See,	it	is	ready.	Mais	vraiment,	you	shall	drink	café	noir	to-night.	And	one	leetle	glass	of	this—is	it	not	so?"	and	she	took	a	green	bottle	of peppermint	liqueur	from	the	cupboard.

"Coffee,	Louise,"	he	said,	"but	not	the	other.	I	don't	want	it."

She	turned	and	looked	more	closely	at	him	then.	"Non,"	she	said,	"pardon.	But sit	you	down.	Am	I	to	have	the	wild	beast	prowling	up	and	down	in	my	place?"

"That's	just	it,	Louise,"	he	cried;	"I	am	a	wild	beast	to-night.	I	can't	stand	it	any longer.	Kiss	me."

He	put	his	arms	round	her,	and	bent	her	head	back,	studying	her	French	and rather	inscrutable	eyes,	her	dark	lashes,	her	mobile	mouth,	her	long	white	throat.

He	put	his	hand	caressingly	upon	it,	and	slid	his	fingers	beneath	the	loose	lace that	the	open	wrap	exposed.	"Dear,"	he	said,	"I	want	you	to-night."

"To-night,	chérie?"	she	questioned.

"Yes,	now,"	he	said	hotly.	"And	why	not?	You	give	to	other	men—why	not	to me,	Louise?"

She	freed	herself	with	a	quick	gesture,	and,	brave	heart,	she	laughed	merrily.	The devil	must	have	started	at	that	laugh,	and	the	angels	of	God	sung	for	joy.	"Ah, non,"	she	cried,	"It	is	the	mistake	you	make.	I	 sell	myself	to	other	men.	But	you

—you	are	my	friend;	I	cannot	sell	myself	to	you."

He	did	not	understand	altogether	why	she	quibbled;	how	should	he	have	done?

But	lie	was	ashamed.	He	slid	into	the	familiar	chair	and	ran	his	fingers	through his	hair.	"Forgive	me,	dear,"	he	muttered.	"I	think	I	am	mad	to-night,	but	I	am not	drunk,	as	you	thought,	except	with	worrying.	I	feel	lost,	unclean,	body	and soul,	and	I	thought	you	would	help	me	to	forget—no,	more	than	that,	help	me	to feel	a	man.	Can't	you,	won't	you?"	he	demanded,	looking	up.	"I	am	tired	of	play-acting.	I've	a	body,	like	other	men.	Let	me	plunge	down	deep	to-night,	Louise.	It will	do	me	good,	and	it	doesn't	matter.	That	girl	was	right	after	all.	Oh,	what	a fool	I	am!"

Then	did	the	girl	of	the	streets	set	out	to	play	her	chosen	part.	She	did	not	preach at	all—how	could	she?	Besides,	neither	had	she	any	use	for	the	Ten Commandments.	But	if	ever	Magdalene	broke	an	alabaster-box	of	very	precious ointment,	Louise	did	so	that	night.	She	was	worldly	wise,	and	she	did	not	disdain to	use	her	wisdom.	And	when	he	had	gone	she	got	calmly	into	bed,	and	slept—

not	all	at	once,	it	is	true,	but	as	resolutely	as	she	had	laughed	and	talked.	It	was only	when	she	woke	in	the	morning	that	she	found	her	pillow	wet	with	tears.

It	was	a	few	days	later	that	Louise	took	Peter	to	church.	His	ignorance	of	her religion	greatly	amused	her,	or	so	at	least	she	pretended,	and	when	he	asked	her to	come	out	of	town	to	lunch	one	morning,	and	she	refused	because	it	was Corpus	Christi,	and	she	wanted	to	go	to	the	sung	Mass,	it	was	he	who	suggested that	he	should	go	with	her.	She	looked	at	him	queerly	a	moment,	and	then agreed.	They	met	outside	the	church	and	went	in	together,	as	strange	a	pair	as ever	the	meshes	of	that	ancient	net	which	gathers	of	all	kinds	had	ever	drawn towards	the	shore.

Louise	led	him	to	a	central	seat,	and	found	the	place	for	him	in	her	Prayer-Book.

The	building	was	full,	and	Peter	glanced	about	him	curiously.	The	detachment	of the	worshippers	impressed	him	immensely.	There	did	not	appear	to	be	any proscribed	procedure	among	them,	and	even	when	the	Mass	began	he	was	one	of the	few	who	stood	and	knelt	as	the	rubrics	of	the	service	directed.	Louise	made no	attempt	to	do	so.	For	the	most	part	she	knelt,	and	her	beads	trickled ceaselessly	through	her	fingers.

Peter	was,	if	anything,	bored	by	the	Mass,	though	he	would	not	admit	it	to himself.	It	struck	him	as	being	a	ratherly	poorly	played	performance.	True,	the officiating	ministers	moved	and	spoke	with	a	calm	regularity	which	impressed him,	familiar	as	he	was	with	clergymen	who	gave	out	hymns	and	notices,	and with	his	own	solicitude	at	home	that	the	singing	should	go	well	or	that	the choirboys	should	not	fidget.	But	there	was	a	terrible	confusion	with	chairs,	and	a hideous	kind	of	clapper	that	was	used,	apparently,	to	warn	the	boys	to	sit	and rise.	The	service,	moreover,	as	a	reverential	congregational	act	of	worship	such as	he	was	used	to	hope	for,	was	marred	by	innumerable	collections,	and especially	by	the	old	woman	who	came	round	even	during	the	 Sanctus	to	collect the	rent	of	the	chairs	they	occupied,	and	changed	money	or	announced	prices with	all	the	zest	of	the	market-place.

But	at	the	close	there	was	a	procession	which	is	worth	considerable	description.

Six	men	with	censers	of	silver	lined	up	before	the	high	altar,	and	stood	there, slowly	swinging	the	fragrant	bowls	at	the	end	of	their	long	chains.	The	music died	down.	One	could	hear	the	rhythmical,	faint	clangour	of	the	metal.	And	then, intensely	sudden,	away	in	the	west	gallery,	but	almost	as	if	from	the	battlements of	heaven,	pealed	out	silver	trumpets	in	a	fanfare.	The	censers	flew	high	in	time with	it,	and	the	sweet	clouds	of	smoke,	caught	by	the	coloured	sunlight	of	the rich	painted	windows,	unfolded	in	the	air	of	the	sanctuary.	Lights	moved	and danced,	and	the	space	before	the	altar	filled	with	the	white	of	the	men	and	boys who	should	move	in	the	procession.	Again	and	again	those	trumpets	rang	out, and	hardly	had	the	last	echoes	died	away	than	the	organ	thundered	the	 Pange Lingua,	as	a	priest	in	cloth	of	gold	turned	from	the	altar	with	the	glittering monstrance	in	his	hand.	Even	from	where	he	stood	Peter	could	see	the	white centre	of	the	Host	for	Whom	all	this	was	enacted.	Then	the	canopy,	borne	by four	French	laymen	in	frock-coats	and	white	gloves,	hid	It	from	his	sight;	and the	high	gold	cross,	and	its	attendant	tapers,	swung	round	a	great	buttress	into view.

Peter	had	never	heard	a	hymn	sung	so	before.	First	the	organ	would	peal	alone; then	the	men's	voices	unaided	would	take	up	the	refrain;	then	the	organ	again; then	the	clear	treble	of	the	boys;	then,	like	waves	breaking	on	immemorial	cliffs, organ,	trumpets,	boys,	men,	and	congregation	would	thunder	out	together	till	the blood	raced	in	his	veins	and	his	eyes	were	too	dim	to	see.

Down	the	central	aisle	at	last	they	came,	and	Peter	knelt	with	the	rest.	He	saw how	the	boys	went	before	throwing	flowers;	how	in	pairs,	as	the	censers	were recharged,	the	thurifers	walked	backward	before	the	three	beneath	the	canopy,	of whom	one,	white-haired	and	old,	bore	That	in	the	monstrance	which	all	adored.

In	music	and	light	and	colour	and	scent	the	Host	went	by,	as	It	had	gone	for centuries	in	that	ancient	place,	and	Peter	knew,	all	bewildered	as	he	was,	there, by	the	side	of	the	girl,	that	a	new	vista	was	opening	before	his	eyes.

It	was	not	that	he	understood	as	yet,	or	scarcely	so.	In	a	few	minutes	all	had passed	them,	and	he	rose	and	turned	to	see	the	end.	He	watched	while,	amid	the splendour	of	that	court,	with	singers	and	ministers	and	thurifers	arranged	before, the	priest	ascended	to	enthrone	the	Sacrament	in	the	place	prepared	for	It.	With banks	of	flowers	behind,	and	the	glitter	of	electric	as	well	as	of	candle	light,	the jewelled	rays	of	the	monstrance	gleaming	and	the	organ	pealing	note	on	note	in	a triumphant	ecstasy,	the	old,	bent	priest	placed	That	he	carried	there,	and	sank down	before	It.	Then	all	sound	of	singing	and	of	movement	died	away,	and	from

that	kneeling	crowd	one	lone,	thin	voice,	but	all	unshaken,	cried	to	Heaven	of the	need	of	men.	It	was	a	short	prayer	and	he	could	not	understand	it,	but	it seemed	to	Peter	to	voice	his	every	need,	and	to	go	on	and	on	till	it	reached	the Throne.	The	"Amen"	beat	gently	about	him,	and	he	sank	his	face	in	his	hands.

But	only	for	a	second.	The	next	he	was	lifted	to	his	feet.	All	that	had	gone	before was	as	nothing	to	this	volume	of	praise	that	shook,	it	seemed	to	him,	the	very carven	roof	above	and	swept	the	ancient	walls	in	waves	of	sound.

Adoremus	in	aeternum	Sanctissimum	Sacramentum,	cried	men	on	earth,	and,	as it	seemed	to	him,	the	very	angels	of	God.

But	outside	he	collected	his	thoughts.	"Well,"	he	said.	"I'm	glad	I've	been,	but	I shan't	go	again."

"Why	not?"	demanded	Louise.	"It	was	most	beautiful.	I	have	never	'eard	it better."

"Oh	yes,	it	was,"	said	Peter;	"the	music	and	singing	were	wonderful,	but—

forgive	me	if	I	hurt	you,	but	I	can't	help	saying	it—I	see	now	what	our	people mean	when	they	say	it	is	nothing	less	than	idolatry."

"Idolatry?"	queried	Louise,	stumblingly	and	bewildered.	"But	what	do	you mean?"

"Well,"	said	Peter,	"the	Sacrament	is,	of	course,	a	holy	thing,	a	very	holy	thing, the	sign	and	symbol	of	Christ	Himself,	but	in	that	church	sign	and	symbol	were forgotten;	the	Sacrament	was	worshipped	as	if	it	were	very	God."

"Oui,	oui,"	protested	Louise	vehemently,	"It	is.	It	is	le	bon	Jesu.	It	is He	who	is	there.	He	passed	by	us	among	them	all,	as	we	read	He	went through	the	crowds	of	Jerusalem	in	the	holy	Gospel.	And	there	was	not	one He	did	not	see,	either,"	she	added,	with	a	little	break	in	her	voice.

Peter	all	but	stopped	in	the	road.	It	was	absurd	that	so	simple	a	thing	should	have seemed	to	him	new,	but	it	is	so	with	us	all.	We	know	in	a	way,	but	we	do	not understand,	and	then	there	comes	the	moment	of	illumination—sometimes.

"Jesus	Himself!"	he	exclaimed,	and	broke	off	abruptly.	He	recalled	a	fragment	of speech:	"Not	a	dead	man,	not	a	man	on	the	right	hand	of	the	throne	of	God."	But

"He	can't	be	found,"	Langton	had	said.	Was	it	so?	He	walked	on	in	silence.	What if	Louise,	with	her	pitiful	story	and	her	caged,	earthy	life,	had	after	all	found what	the	other	had	missed?	He	pulled	himself	together;	it	was	too	good	to	be true.

One	day	Louise	asked	him	abruptly	if	he	had	been	to	see	the	girl	in	the	house which	he	had	visited	with	Pennell.	He	told	her	no,	and	she	said—they	had	met by	chance	in	the	town—"Well,	go	you	immediately,	then,	or	you	will	not	see her."

"What	do	you	mean?"	he	asked.	"Is	she	ill—dying?"

"Ah,	non,	not	dying,	but	she	is	ill.	They	will	take	her	to	a	'ospital	to-morrow.	But this	afternoon	she	will	be	in	bed.	She	like	to	see	you,	I	think."

Peter	left	her	and	made	for	the	house.	On	his	way	he	thought	of	something,	and took	a	turning	which	led	to	the	market-place	of	flowers.	There,	at	a	stall,	he bought	a	big	bunch	of	roses	and	some	sprays	of	asparagus	fern,	and	set	off	again.

Arriving,	he	found	the	door	shut.	It	was	a	dilemma,	for	he	did	not	even	know	the girl's	name,	but	he	knocked.

A	grim-faced	woman	opened	the	door	and	stared	at	him	and	his	flowers.	"I	think there	is	a	girl	sick	here,"	said	Peter.	"May	I	see	her?"

The	woman	stared	still	harder,	and	he	thought	she	was	going	to	refuse	him admission,	but	at	length	she	gave	way.	"Entrez,"	she	said.	"Je	pense	que	vous savez	le	chambre.	Mais,	le	bouquet—c'est	incroyable."

Peter	went	up	the	stairs	and	knocked	at	the	door.	A	voice	asked	who	was	there, and	he	smiled	because	he	could	not	say.	The	girl	did	not	know	his	name,	either.

"A	friend,"	he	said:	"May	I	come	in?"

A	note	of	curiosity	sounded	in	her	voice.	"Oui,	certainement.	Entrez,"	she	called.

Peter	turned	the	handle	and	entered	the	remembered	room.

The	girl	was	sitting	up	in	bed	in	her	nightdress,	her	hair	in	disorder,	and	the	room felt	hot	and	stuffy	and	looked	more	tawdry	than	ever.	She	exclaimed	at	the	sight of	his	flowers.	He	deposited	the	big	bunch	by	the	side	of	her,	and	seated	himself on	the	edge	of	the	bed.	She	had	been	reading	a	book,	and	he	noticed	it	was	the sort	of	book	that	Langton	and	he	had	seen	so	prominently	in	the	book-shop	at

Abbeville.

If	he	had	expected	to	find	her	depressed	or	ashamed,	he	was	entirely	mistaken.

"Oh,	you	darling,"	she	cried	in	clipped	English.	"Kiss	me,	quick,	or	I	will	forget the	orders	of	the	doctor	and	jump	out	of	bed	and	catch	you.	Oh,	that	you	should bring	me	the	rose	so	beautiful!	Hélas!	I	may	not	wear	one	this	night	in	the	café!

See,	are	they	not	beautiful	here?"

She	pulled	her	nightdress	open	considerably	more	than	the	average	evening dress	is	cut	away	and	put	two	or	three	of	the	blooms	on	her	white	bosom,	putting her	head	on	one	side	to	see	the	result.	"Oui,"	she	exclaimed,	"je	suis	exquise!	To-night	I	'ave	so	many	boys	I	do	not	know	what	to	do!	But	I	forget:	I	cannot	go.	Je suis	malade,	très	malade.	You	knew?	You	are	angry	with	me—is	it	not	so?"

He	laughed;	there	was	nothing	else	to	do.	"No,"	he	said;	"why	should	I	be?	But	I am	very	sorry."

She	shrugged	her	shoulders.	"It	is	nothing,"	she	said.	"C'est	la	guerre	for	me.	I shall	not	be	long,	and	when	I	come	out	you	will	come	to	see	me	again,	will	you not?	And	bring	me	more	flowers?	And	you	shall	not	let	me	'ave	the	danger	any more,	and	if	I	do	wrong	you	shall	smack	me	'ard.	Per'aps	you	will	like	that.	In the	books	men	like	it	much.	Would	you	like	to	whip	me?"	she	demanded,	her eyes	sparkling	as	she	threw	herself	over	in	the	bed	and	looked	up	at	him.

Peter	got	up	and	moved	away	to	the	window.	"No,"	he	said	shortly,	staring	out.

He	had	a	sensation	of	physical	nausea,	and	it	was	as	much	as	he	could	do	to restrain	himself.	He	realised,	suddenly,	that	he	was	in	the	presence	of	the	world, the	flesh,	and	the	devil's	final	handiwork.	Only	his	new	knowledge	kept	him quiet.	Even	she	might	be	little	to	blame.	He	remembered	all	that	she	had	said	to him	before,	and	suddenly	his	disgust	was	turned	into	overwhelming	pity.	This child	before	him—for	she	was	little	more	than	a	child—had	bottomed degradation.	For	the	temporary	protection	and	favour	of	a	man	that	she	guessed to	be	kind	there	was	nothing	in	earth	or	in	hell	that	she	would	not	do.	And	in	her already	were	the	seeds	of	the	disease	that	was	all	but	certain	to	slay	her.

He	turned	again	to	the	bed,	and	knelt	beside	it.	"Poor	little	girl,"	he	said,	and lightly	brushed	her	hair.	He	certainly	never	expected	the	result.

She	pushed	him	from	her.	"Oh,	go,	go!"	she	cried.	"Quick	go!	You	pretend,	but you	do	not	love	me.	Why	you	give	me	money,	the	flowers,	if	you	do	not	want

me?	Go	quick.	Come	never	to	see	me	again!"

Peter	did	the	only	thing	he	could	do;	he	went.	"Good-bye,"	he	said	cheerfully	at the	door.	"I	hope	you	will	be	better	soon.	I	didn't	mean	to	be	a	beast	to	you.	Give the	flowers	to	Lucienne	if	you	don't	want	them;	she	will	be	able	to	wear	them	to-night.	Cheerio.	Good-bye-ee!"

"Good-bye-ee!"	she	echoed	after	him.	And	he	closed	the	door	on	her	life.

In	front	of	the	Hôtel	de	Ville	he	met	Arnold,	returning	from	the	club,	and	the	two men	walked	off	together.	In	a	moment	of	impulse	he	related	the	whole	story	to him.	"Now,"	he	said,	"what	do	you	make	of	all	that?"

Arnold	was	very	moved.	It	was	not	his	way	to	say	much,	but	he	walked	on silently	for	a	long	time.	Then	he	said:	"The	Potter	makes	many	vessels,	but	never one	needlessly.	I	hold	on	to	that.	And	He	can	remake	the	broken	clay."

"Are	you	sure?"	asked	Peter.

"I	am,"	said	Arnold.	"It's	not	in	the	Westminster	Confession,	nor	in	the	Book	of Common	Prayer,	nor,	for	all	I	know,	in	the	Penny	Catechism,	but	I	believe	it.

God	Almighty	must	be	stronger	than	the	devil,	Graham."

Peter	considered	this.	Then	he	shook	his	head.	"That	won't	wash,	Arnold,"	he said.	"If	God	is	stronger	than	the	devil,	so	that	the	devil	is	never	ultimately	going to	succeed,	I	can	see	no	use	in	letting	him	have	his	fling	at	all.	And	I've	more respect	for	the	devil	than	to	think	he'd	take	it.	It's	childish	to	suppose	the existence	of	two	such	forces	at	a	perpetual	game	of	cheat.	Either	there	is	no	devil and	there	is	no	hell—in	which	case	I	reckon	that	there	is	no	heaven	either,	for	a heaven	would	not	be	a	heaven	if	it	were	not	attained,	and	there	would	be	no	true attainment	if	there	were	no	possibility	of	failure—or	else	there	are	all	three.	And if	there	are	all	three,	the	devil	wins	out,	sometimes,	in	the	end."

"Then,	God	is	not	almighty?"

Peter	shrugged	his	shoulders.	"If	I	breed	white	mice,	I	don't	lessen	my	potential power	if	I	choose	to	let	some	loose	in	the	garden	to	see	if	the	cat	will	get	them.

Besides,	in	the	end	I	could	annihilate	the	cat	if	I	wanted	to."

"You	can't	think	of	God	so,"	cried	Arnold	sharply.

"Can't	I?"	demanded	Peter.	"Well,	maybe	not,	Arnold;	I	don't	know	that	I	can think	of	Him	at	all.	But	I	can	face	the	facts	of	life,	and	if	I'm	not	a	coward,	I shan't	run	away	from	them.	That's	what	I've	been	doing	these	days,	and	that's what	I	do	not	think	even	a	man	like	yourself	does	fairly.	You	think,	I	take	it,	that a	girl	like	that	is	damned	utterly	by	all	the	canons	of	theology,	and	then,	forced on	by	pity	and	tenderness,	you	cry	out	against	them	all	that	she	is	God's	making and	He	will	not	throw	her	away.	Is	that	it?"

Arnold	slightly	evaded	an	answer.	"How	can	you	save	her,	Graham?"	he	asked.

"I	can't.	I	don't	pretend	I	can.	I've	nothing	to	say	or	do.	I	see	only	one	flicker	of hope,	and	that	lies	in	the	fact	that	she	doesn't	understand	what	love	is.	No shadow	of	the	truth	has	ever	come	her	way.	If	now,	by	any	chance,	she	could	see for	one	instant—in	 fact,	mind	you—the	face	of	God….	If	God	is	Love,"	he added.	They	walked	a	dozen	paces.	"And	even	then	she	might	refuse,"	he	said.

"Whose	fault	would	that	be?"	demanded	the	older	man.

Peter	answered	quickly,	"Whose	fault?	Why,	all	our	faults—yours	and	mine,	and the	fault	of	men	like	Pennell	and	Donovan,	as	well	as	her	own,	too,	as	like	as not.	We've	all	helped	build	up	the	scheme	of	things	as	they	are,	and	we	are	all responsible.	We	curse	the	Germans	for	making	this	damned	war,	and	it	is	the	war that	has	done	most	to	make	that	girl;	but	they	didn't	make	it.	No	Kaiser	made	it, and	no	Nietzsche.	The	only	person	who	had	no	hand	in	it	that	I	know	of	was Jesus	Christ."

"And	those	who	have	left	all	and	followed	Him,"	said	Arnold	softly.

"Precious	few,"	retorted	Peter.

The	other	had	nothing	to	say.

*	*	*	*	*

During	these	months	Peter	wrote	often	to	Hilda,	and	with	increasing	frankness.

Her	replies	grew	shorter	as	his	letters	grew	longer.	It	was	strange,	perhaps,	that he	should	continue	to	write,	but	the	explanation	was	not	far	to	seek.	It	was	by	her that	he	gauged	the	extent	of	his	separation	from	the	old	outlook,	and	in	her	that he	still	clung,	desperately,	as	it	were,	to	the	past.	Against	reason	he	elevated	her into	a	kind	of	test	position,	and	if	her	replies	gave	him	no	encouragement,	they	at

least	served	to	make	him	feel	the	inevitableness	and	the	reality	of	his	present position.	It	would	have	been	easy	to	get	into	the	swim	and	let	it	carry	him carelessly	on—moderately	easy,	at	any	rate.	But	with	Hilda	to	refer	to	he	was forced	to	take	notice,	and	it	was	she,	therefore,	that	hastened	the	end.	Just	after Christmas,	in	a	fit	of	temporary	boldness,	he	told	her	about	Louise,	so	that	it	was Louise	again	who	was	the	responsible	person	during	these	months.	Hilda's	reply was	delayed,	nor	had	she	written	immediately.	When	he	got	it,	it	was	brief	but	to the	point.	She	did	not	doubt,	she	said,	but	that	what	he	had	written	was	strictly true,	and	she	did	not	doubt	his	honour.	But	he	must	see	that	their	relationship was	impossible.	She	couldn't	marry	the	man	who	appeared	actually	to	like	the company	of	such	a	woman,	nor	could	she	do	other	than	feel	that	the	end	would seem	to	him	as	plain	as	it	did	to	her,	and	that	he	would	leave	the	Church,	or	at any	rate	such	a	ministry	in	it	as	she	could	share.	She	had	told	her	people	that	she was	no	longer	engaged	in	order	that	he	should	feel	free,	but	she	would	ever remember	the	man	as	she	had	known	him,	whom	she	had	loved,	and	whom	she loved	still.

It	was	in	the	afternoon	that	Peter	got	the	letter,	and	he	was	just	setting	off	for	the hospital.	When	he	had	read	it,	he	put	on	his	cap	and	set	off	in	the	opposite direction.	There	was	a	walk	along	the	sea-wall	a	few	feet	wide,	where	the	wind blew	strongly	laden	with	the	Channel	breezes,	and	on	the	other	side	was	a	waste of	sand	and	stone.	In	some	places	water	was	on	both	sides	of	the	wall,	and	here one	could	feel	more	alone	than	anywhere	else	in	the	town.

Peter	set	off,	his	head	in	a	mad	whirl.	He	had	felt	that	such	a	letter	would	come for	weeks,	but	that	did	not,	in	a	way,	lessen	the	blow	when	it	came.	He	had known,	too,	that	Hilda	was	not	to	him	what	she	had	been,	but	he	had	not altogether	felt	that	she	never	could	be	so	again.	Now	he	knew	that	he	had	gone too	far	to	turn	back.	He	felt,	he	could	not	help	it,	released	in	a	sense,	with	almost a	sense	of	exhilaration	behind	it,	for	the	unknown	lay	before.	And	yet,	since	we are	all	so	human,	he	was	intensely	unhappy	below	all	this.	He	called	to	mind little	scenes	and	bits	of	scenes:	their	first	meeting;	the	sight	of	her	in	church	as he	preached;	how	she	had	looked	at	the	dining-table	in	Park	Lane;	her	walk	as she	came	to	meet	him	in	the	park.	And	he	knew	well	enough	how	he	had	hurt her,	and	the	thought	maddened	him.	He	told	himself	that	God	was	a	devil	to	treat him	so;	that	he	had	tried	to	follow	the	right;	and	that	the	way	had	led	him	down towards	nothing	but	despair.	He	was	no	nearer	answering	the	problems	that	beset him.	He	might	have	been	in	a	fool's	paradise	before,	but	what	was	the	use	of coming	out	to	see	the	devil	as	he	was	and	men	and	women	as	they	were	if	he

could	see	no	more	than	that?	The	throne	of	his	heart	was	empty,	and	there	was none	to	fill	it.

Julie?





CHAPTER	V

The	sea-wall	ended	not	far	from	Donovan's	camp	of	mud	and	cinders,	and having	got	there,	Peter	thought	he	would	go	on	and	get	a	cup	of	tea.	He	crossed the	railway-lines,	steered	through	a	great	American	rest	camp,	crossed	the	canal, and	entered	the	camp.	It	was	a	cheerless	place	in	winter,	and	the	day	was drawing	in	early	with	a	damp	fog.	A	great	French	airship	was	cruising	around overhead	and	dropping	down	towards	her	resting-place	in	the	great	hangar	near by.	She	looked	cold	and	ghostly	up	aloft,	the	more	so	when	her	engines	were shut	off,	and	Peter	thought	how	chilly	her	crew	must	be.	He	had	a	hankering after	Donovan's	cheery	humour,	especially	as	he	had	not	seen	him	for	some	time.

He	crossed	the	camp	and	made	for	the	mess-room.

It	was	lit	and	the	curtains	were	drawn,	and,	at	the	door,	he	stopped	dead	at	the sound	of	laughter.	Then	he	walked	quickly	in.	"Caught	out,	by	Jove!"	said Donovan's	voice.	"You're	for	it,	Julie."

A	merry	party	sat	round	the	stove,	taking	tea.	Julie	and	Miss	Raynard	were	both there,	with	Pennell	and	another	man	from	Donovan's	camp.	Julie	wore	furs	and had	plainly	just	come	in,	for	her	cheeks	were	glowing	with	exercise.	Pennell	was sitting	next	Miss	Raynard,	but	Donovan,	on	a	wooden	camp-seat,	just	beyond where	Julie	sat	in	a	big	cushioned	chair,	looked	out	at	him	from	almost	under Julie's	arm,	as	he	bent	forward.	The	other	man	was	standing	by	the	table,	teapot in	hand.

One	thinks	quickly	at	such	a	time,	and	Peter's	mind	raced.	Something	of	the	old envy	and	almost	fear	of	Donovan	that	he	had	had	first	that	day	in	the	hospital came	back	to	him.	He	had	not	seen	the	two	together	for	so	long	that	it	struck	him like	a	blow	to	hear	Donovan	call	her	by	her	Christian	name.	It	flashed	across	his mind	also	that	she	knew	that	it	was	his	day	at	the	hospital,	and	that	she	had deliberately	gone	out;	but	it	dawned	on	him	equally	quickly	that	he	must	hide	all that.

"I	should	jolly	well	think	so,"	he	said,	laughing.	"How	do	you	do,	Miss	Raynard?

Donovan,	can	you	give	me	some	tea?	I've	come	along	the	sea-wall,	and	picked up	a	regular	appetite.	Are	you	in	the	habit	of	taking	tea	here,	Julie?	I	thought nurses	were	not	allowed	in	camps."

She	looked	at	him	quickly,	but	he	missed	the	meaning	of	her	glance.

"Rather,"	she	said;	"I	come	here	for	tea	about	once	a	week,	don't	I, Jack?	No,	nurses	are	not	allowed	in	camps,	but	I	always	do	what's	not allowed	as	far	as	possible.	And	this	is	so	snug	and	out	of	the	way.	Mr.

Pennell,	you	can	give	me	a	cigarette	now."

The	other	man	offered	Peter	tea,	which	he	took.	"And	how	did	the	festivities	go off	at	Christmas?"	he	asked.

"Oh,	topping,"	said	Julie.	"Let	me	see,	you	were	at	the	play,	so	I	needn't	talk about	that;	but	you	thought	it	good,	didn't	you?"

"Rippin'"	said	Peter.

"Well,"	said	Julie,	"then	there	was	the	dance	on	Boxing	Night.	We	had	glorious fun.	Jack,	here,	behaved	perfectly	abominably.	He	sat	out	about	half	the	dances, and	I	should	think	he	kissed	every	pretty	girl	in	the	room.	Then	we	went	down	to the	nurses'	quarters	of	the	officers'	hospital	and	made	cocoa	of	all	things,	and	had a	few	more	dances	on	our	own.	They	made	me	dance	a	skirt	dance	on	the	table, and	as	I	had	enough	laces	on	this	time,	I	did.	After	that—but	I	don't	think	I'll	tell you	what	we	did	after	that.	Why	didn't	you	come?"

Peter	had	been	at	a	big	Boxing	Night	entertainment	for	the	troops	in	the Y.M.C.A.	Central	Hall,	but	he	did	not	say	so.	"Oh,"	he	said,	"I	had	to	go	to another	stunt,	but	I	must	say	I	wish	I'd	been	at	yours.	May	I	have	another	cup	of tea?"

The	third	man	gave	it	to	him	again,	and	then,	apologizing,	left	the	room.

Donovan	exchanged	glances	with	Julie,	and	she	nodded.

"I	say,	Graham,"	said	Donovan,	"I'll	tell	you	what	we've	really	met	here	for	to-day.	We	were	going	to	fix	it	up	and	then	ask	you;	but	as	you've	dropped	in,	we'll take	it	as	a	dispensation	of	Providence	and	let	you	into	the	know.	What	do	you say	to	a	really	sporting	dinner	at	the	New	Year?"

"Who's	to	be	asked?"	queried	Peter,	looking	round.	"Fives	into	a	dinner	won't go."

"I	should	think	not,"	cried	Julie	gaily.	"Jack,	here,	is	taking	me,	aren't	you?"

Donovan	said	"I	am"	with	great	emphasis,	and	made	as	if	he	would	kiss	her,	and she	pushed	him	off,	laughing,	holding	her	muff	to	his	face.	Then	she	went	on:

"You're	to	take	Tommy.	It	is	Tommy's	own	particular	desire,	and	you	ought	to feel	flattered.	She	says	your	auras	blend,	whatever	that	may	be;	and	as	to	Mr.

Pennell,	he's	got	a	girl	elsewhere	whom	he	will	ask.	Three	and	three	make	six; what	do	you	think	of	that?"

"Julie,"	said	Tommy	Raynard	composedly,	"you're	the	most	fearful	liar I've	ever	met.	But	I	trust	Captain	Graham	knows	you	well	enough	by	now."

"I	do,"	said	Peter,	but	a	trifle	grimly,	though	he	tried	not	to	show	it—"I	do.	I must	say	I'm	jolly	glad	Donovan	will	be	responsible	for	you.	It's	going	to	be

'some'	evening,	I	can	see,	and	what	you'll	do	if	you	get	excited	I	don't	know.	Flirt with	the	proprietor	and	have	his	wife	down	on	us,	as	like	as	not.	In	which	event it's	Donovan	who'll	have	to	make	the	explanations.	But	come	on,	what	are	the details?"

"Tell	him,	Jack,"	said	Julie.	"He's	a	perfect	beast,	and	I	shan't	speak	to	him again."

Peter	laughed.	"Pas	possible,"	he	said.	"But	come	on,	Donovan;	do	as	you're told."

"Well,	old	bird,"	said	Donovan,	"first	we	meet	here.	Got	that?	It's	safer	than	any other	camp,	and	we	don't	want	to	meet	in	town.	We'll	have	tea	and	a	chat	and then	clear	off.	We'll	order	dinner	in	a	private	room	at	the	Grand,	and	it'll	be	a dinner	fit	for	the	occasion.	They've	got	some	priceless	sherry	there,	and	some	old white	port.	Cognac	fine	champagne	for	the	liqueur,	and	what	date	do	you	think?

—1835	as	I'm	alive.	I	saw	some	the	other	day,	and	spoke	about	it.	That	gave	me the	idea	of	the	dinner	really,	and	I	put	it	to	the	old	horse	that	that	brandy	was worthy	of	a	dinner	to	introduce	it.	He	tumbled	at	once.	Veuve	Cliquot	as	the main	wine.	What	about	it?"

Peter	balanced	himself	on	the	back	of	his	chair	and	blew	out	cigarette-smoke.

"What	time	are	you	ordering	the	ambulances?"	he	demanded.

"The	beds,	you	mean,"	cried	Julie,	entirely	forgetting	her	last	words.

"That's	what	I	say. I	shall	never	be	able	to	walk	to	a	taxi	even."

"I'll	carry	you,"	said	Donovan.

"You	won't	be	able,	not	after	such	a	night;	besides,	I	don't	believe	you	could, anyhow.	You're	getting	flabby	from	lack	of	exercise."

"Am	I?"	cried	Donovan.	"Let's	see,	anyway."

He	darted	at	her,	slipped	an	arm	under	her	skirts	and	another	under	her	arms,	and lifted	her	bodily	from	the	chair.

"Jack,"	she	shrieked,	"put	me	down!	Oh,	you	beast!	Tommy,	help,	help!

Peter,	make	him	put	me	down	and	I'll	forgive	you	all	you've	said."

Tommy	Raynard	sprang	up,	laughing,	and	ran	after	Donovan,	who	could	not escape	her.	She	threw	an	arm	round	his	neck	and	bent	his	head	backwards.	"I shall	drop	her,"	he	shouted.	Peter	leaped	forward,	and	Julie	landed	in	his	arms.

For	a	second	she	lay	still,	and	Peter	stared	down	at	her.	With	her	quick	intuition she	read	something	new	in	his	eyes,	and	instantly	looked	away,	scrambling	out and	standing	there	flushed	and	breathing	hard,	her	hands	at	her	hair.	"You	perfect brute!"	she	said	to	Donovan,	laughing.	"I'll	pay	you	out,	see	if	I	don't.	All	my hair's	coming	down."

"Capital!"	said	Donovan.	"I've	never	seen	it	down,	and	I'd	love	to.	Here,	let	me help."

He	darted	at	her;	she	dodged	behind	Peter;	he	adroitly	put	out	a	foot,	and Donovan	collapsed	into	the	big	chair.

Julie	clapped	her	hands	and	rushed	at	him,	seizing	a	cushion,	and	the	two struggled	there	till	Tommy	Raynard	pulled	Julie	forcibly	away.

"Julie,"	she	said,	"this	is	a	positive	bear-garden.	You	must	behave."

"And	I,"	said	Pennell,	who	had	not	moved,	"would	like	to	know	a	little	more about	the	dinner."	He	spoke	so	dryly	that	they	all	laughed,	and	order	was restored.	Donovan,	however,	refused	to	get	out	of	the	big	chair,	and	Julie

deliberately	sat	on	his	knee,	smiling	provocatively	at	him.

Peter	felt	savage	and	bitter.	Like	a	man,	he	was	easily	deceived,	and	he	had	been taken	by	surprise	at	a	bad	moment.	But	he	did	his	best	to	hide	it,	and	merely threw	any	remnants	of	caution	he	had	left	at	all	to	the	winds.

"I	suppose	this	is	the	best	we	can	hope	for,	Captain	Graham,"	said	Miss	Raynard placidly.	"Perhaps	now	you'll	give	us	your	views.	Captain	Donovan	never	gets beyond	the	drinks,	but	I	agree	with	Mr.	Pennell	we	want	something	substantial."

"I'm	blest	if	I	don't	think	you	all	confoundedly	ungrateful,"	said	Donovan.	"I worked	that	fine	champagne	for	you	beautifully.	Anyone	would	think	you	could walk	in	and	order	it	any	day.	If	we	get	it	at	all,	it'll	be	due	to	me	and	my	blarney.

Not	but	what	it	does	deserve	a	good	introduction,"	he	added.	"I	don't	suppose there's	another	bottle	in	the	town."

Tommy	sighed.	"He's	off	again,	or	he	will	be,"	she	said.	"Do	be	quick, Captain	Graham."

"Well,"	said	Peter.	"I	suggest,	first,	that	you	leave	the	ordering	of	the	room	to me,	and	the	decorations.	I've	most	time,	and	I'd	like	to	choose	the	flowers.	And the	smokes	and	crackers.	And	I'll	worry	round	and	get	some	menu-cards,	and have	'em	printed	in	style.	And,	if	you	like,	I'll	interview	the	chef	and	see	what	he can	give	us.	It's	not	much	use	our	discussing	details	without	him."

"'A	Daniel	come	to	judgment,'"	said	Pennell.	"Padre,	I	didn't	know	you	had	it	in you."

"A	Solomon,"	said	Julie	mischievously.

"A	Peter	Graham,"	said	Miss	Raynard.	"I	always	knew	he	had	more	sense	in	his little	finger	than	all	the	rest	of	you	in	your	heads."

Donovan	sighed	from	the	depths	of	the	chair.	"Graham,"	he	said,	"for Heaven's	sake	remember	those…"

Julie	clapped	her	hand	over	his	mouth.	He	kissed	it.	She	withdrew	it	with	a scream.

"…Drinks,"	finished	Donovan.	"The	chef	must	suggest	accordin'."

"Well,"	said	Pennell,	"I	reckon	that's	settled	satisfactorily.	I'll	get	out	my invitation.	In	fact,	I	think,	if	I	may	be	excused,	I'll	go	and	do	it	now."	He	got	up and	reached	for	his	cap.

They	all	laughed.	"We'll	see	to	it	that	there's	mistletoe,"	cried	Julie.

"Ah,	thanks!"	said	Pennell;	"that	will	be	jolly,	though	some	people	I	know	seem to	get	on	well	enough	without	it.	So	long.	See	you	later,	padre."

He	avoided	Julie's	flung	cushion	and	stepped	through	the	door.	Miss Raynard	got	up.	"We	ought	to	get	a	move	on	too,	my	dear,"	she	said	to Julie.

"Oh,	not	yet,"	protested	Donovan.	"Let's	have	some	bridge.	There	are	just	four	of us."

"You	can	never	have	played	bridge	with	Julie,	Captain	Donovan,"	said	Miss Raynard.	"She	usually	flings	the	cards	at	you	half	way	through	the	rubber.	And she	never	counts.	The	other	night	she	played	a	diamond	instead	of	a	heart,	when hearts	were	trumps,	and	she	had	the	last	and	all	the	rest	of	the	tricks	in	her	hand."

"Ah,	well,"	said	Donovan,	"women	are	like	that.	They	often	mistake	diamonds for	hearts."

"Jack,"	said	Julie,	"you're	really	clever.	How	do	you	do	it?	I	had	no	idea.	Does	it hurt?	But	don't	do	it	again;	you	might	break	something.	Peter,	you've	been praised	this	evening,	but	you'd	never	think	of	that."

"He	would	not,"	said	Miss	Raynard….	"Come	on,	Julie."

Peter	hesitated	a	second.	Then	he	said:	"You're	going	my	way.	May	I	see	you home?"

"Thanks,"	said	Miss	Raynard,	and	they	all	made	a	move.

"It's	deuced	dark,"	said	Donovan.	"Here,	let	me.	I'll	go	first	with	a	candle	so	that you	shan't	miss	the	duck-boards."

He	passed	out,	Tommy	Raynard	after	him.	Peter	stood	back	to	let	Julie	pass,	and as	she	did	so	she	said:	"You're	very	glum	and	very	polite	to-night,	Solomon.

What's	the	matter?"

"Am	I?"	said	Peter;	"I	didn't	know	it.	And	in	any	case	Donovan	is	all	right,	isn't he?"

He	could	have	bitten	his	tongue	out	the	next	minute.	She	looked	at	him	and	then began	to	laugh	silently,	and,	still	laughing,	went	out	before	him.	Peter	followed miserably.	At	the	gate	Donovan	said	good-bye,	and	the	three	set	out	for	the hospital.	Miss	Raynard	walked	between	Peter	and	Julie,	and	did	most	of	the talking,	but	the	ground	was	rough	and	the	path	narrow,	and	it	was	not	until	they got	on	to	the	dock	road	that	much	could	be	said.

"This	is	the	best	Christmas	I've	ever	had,"	declared	Miss	Raynard.	"I'm	feeling positively	done	up.	There	was	something	on	every	afternoon	and	evening	last week,	and	then	Julie	sits	on	my	bed	till	daybreak,	more	or	less,	and	smokes cigarettes.	We've	a	bottle	of	benedictine,	too,	and	it	always	goes	to	her	head.	The other	night	she	did	a	Salome	dance	on	the	strength	of	it."

"It	was	really	fine,"	said	Julie.	"You	ought	to	have	seen	me."

"Till	the	towel	slipped	off:	not	then,	I	hope,"	said	Tommy	dryly.

"I	don't	suppose	he'd	have	minded—would	you,	Peter?"

"Not	a	bit,"	said	Peter	cheerfully—"on	the	contrary."

"I	don't	know	if	you	two	are	aware	that	you	are	positively	indecent,"	said Tommy.	"Let's	change	the	subject.	What's	your	news,	Captain	Graham?"

Peter	smiled	in	the	dark	to	himself.	"Well,"	he	said,	"not	much,	but	I'm	hoping for	leave	soon.	I've	pushed	in	for	it,	and	our	Adjutant	told	me	this	morning	he thought	it	would	go	through."

"Lucky	man!	I've	got	to	wait	three	months.	But	yours	ought	to	be	about	now, Julie."

"I	think	it	ought,"	said	Julie	shortly.	Then:	"What	about	the	menu-cards, Peter?	Would	you	like	me	to	help	you	choose	them?"

"Would	you?"	said	he	eagerly.	"To-morrow?"

"I'm	on	duty	at	five	o'clock,	but	I	can	get	off	for	an	hour	in	the	afternoon.	Could you	come,	Tommy?"

"No.	Sorry;	but	I	must	write	letters.	I	haven't	written	one	for	ages."

"Nor	have	I,"	said	Julie,	"but	I	don't	mean	to.	I	hate	letters.	Well,	what	about	it, Peter?"

"I	should	think	we	had	better	try	that	stationer's	in	the	Rue	Thiers,"	he	said.	"If that	won't	do,	the	Nouvelles	Galeries	might.	What	do	you	think?"

"Let's	try	the	Galeries	first.	We	could	meet	there.	Say	at	three,	eh?	I	want	to	get some	baby-ribbon,	too."

Tommy	sighed	audibly.	"She's	off	again,"	she	said.

"Thank	God,	here's	the	hospital!	Good-night,	Captain	Graham.	You	mustn't	cross the	Rubicon	to-night."

"You	oughtn't	to	swear	before	him,"	said	Julie	in	mock	severity.	"And	what	in the	world	is	the	Rubicon?"

"Materially,	to-night,	it's	the	railway-line	between	his	camp	and	the	hospital,"

said	Tommy	Raynard.	"What	else	it	is	I'll	leave	him	to	decide."

She	held	out	her	hand,	and	Peter	saw	a	quizzical	look	on	her	face.	He	turned rather	hopelessly	to	Julie.	"I	say,"	he	said,	"didn't	you	 know	it	was	my	afternoon at	the	hospital?"

"Yes,"	said	Julie,	"and	I	knew	you	didn't	come.	At	least,	I	couldn't	see	you	in	any of	the	wards."

"Oh,"	he	exclaimed,	"I	thought	you'd	been	out	all	the	afternoon.	I'm	sorry.	I	am	a damned	fool,	Julie!"

She	laughed	in	the	darkness.	"I've	known	worse,	Peter,"	she	said,	and	was	gone.

*	*	*	*	*

Next	day	Julie	was	in	her	most	provocative	of	moods.	Peter,	eminently

respectable	in	his	best	tunic,	waited	ten	minutes	for	her	outside	the	Nouvelles Galeries,	and,	like	most	men	in	his	condition,	considered	that	she	was	never coming,	and	that	he	was	the	cynosure	of	neighbouring	eyes.	When	she	did	come, she	was	not	apparently	aware	that	she	was	late.	She	ran	her	eyes	over	him,	and gave	a	pretended	gasp	of	surprise.	"You're	looking	wonderful,	Padre	Graham,"

she	said.	"Really,	you're	hard	to	live	up	to.	I	never	know	what	to	expect	or	how to	behave.	Those	black	buttons	terrorise	me.	Come	on."

She	insisted	on	getting	her	ribbon	first,	and	turned	over	everything	there	was	to be	seen	at	that	counter.	The	French	girl	who	served	them	was	highly	amused.

"Isn't	that	chic?"	Julie	demanded	of	Peter,	holding	up	a	lacy	camisole	and deliberately	putting	it	to	her	shoulders.	"Wouldn't	you	love	to	see	me	in	it?"

"I	would,"	he	said,	without	the	ghost	of	a	smile.

"Well,	you	never	will,	of	course,"	she	said.	"I	shall	never	marry	or	be	given	in marriage,	and	in	any	case,	in	that	uniform,	you've	nothing	whatever	to	hope for….	Yes,	I'll	take	that	ribbon,	thank	you,	ma'm'selle.	Peter,	I	suppose	you	can't carry	it	for	me.	Your	pocket?	Not	a	bad	idea;	but	let	me	put	it	in."

Peter	stood	while	she	undid	his	breast-pocket	and	stuffed	it	inside.

"Anything	more?"	demanded	the	French	saleswoman	interrogatively.

"Not	to-day,	merci,"	said	Julie.	"You	see,	Peter,	you	couldn't	carry	undies	for	me, even	in	your	pocket;	it	wouldn't	be	respectable. Do	come	on.	You	will	keep	us here	the	entire	day."

They	passed	the	smoking	department,	and	she	stopped	suddenly.	"Peter,"	she said,	"I'm	going	to	give	you	a	pipe.	Those	chocolates	you	gave	me	at	Christmas were	too	delicious	for	anything.	What	sort	do	you	like?	A	briar?	Let	me	see	if	it blows	nicely."	She	put	it	to	her	lips.	"I	swear	I	shall	start	a	pipe	soon,	in	my	old age.	By	the	way,	I	don't	believe	you	have	any	idea	how	old	I	am—have	you, Peter?	Guess."

She	was	quick	to	note	the	return	to	his	old	manner.	He	was	nervous	with	her,	not sure	of	himself,	and	so	not	sure	of	her	either.	And	she	traded	on	it.	At	the stationery	department	she	made	eyes	at	a	couple	of	officers,	and	insisted	on examining	Kirschner	picture-postcards,	some	of	which	she	would	not	show	him.

"You	can't	possibly	be	seen	looking	at	them	with	those	badges	up,"	she whispered.	"Dear	me,	if	only	Donovan	were	here!	He	wouldn't	mind,	and	I	don't know	which	packet	I	like	best.	These	have	got	very	little	on,	Peter— very	little, but	I'm	not	sure	that	they	are	not	more	decent	than	those.	It's	 much	worse	than	a camisole,	you	know…."

Peter	was	horribly	conscious	that	the	men	were	smiling	at	her.	"Julie,"	he	said desperately,	" do	be	sensible,	just	for	a	minute.	We	must	get	those	menu-cards."

"Well,	you	go	and	find	the	books,"	she	said	merrily.	"I	told	you	you	ought	not	to watch	me	buy	these.	I'll	take	the	best	care	of	myself,"	and	she	looked	past	him towards	the	men.

Peter	gave	it	up.	"Julie,"	he	said	savagely,	"if	you	make	eyes	any	more, I'll	kiss	you	here	and	now—I	swear	I	will."

Julie	laughed	her	little	nearly	silent	chuckle,	and	looked	at	him.	"I	believe	you would,	Peter,"	she	said,	"and	I	certainly	mustn't	risk	that.	I'll	be	good.	Are	those the	books?	Fetch	me	a	chair,	then,	and	I'll	look	through	them."

He	bent	over	her	as	she	turned	the	leaves.	She	wore	a	little	toque	that	had	some relation	to	a	nurse's	uniform,	but	was	distinctive	of	Julie.	Her	fringe	of	brown hair	lay	along	her	forehead,	and	the	thick	masses	of	the	rest	of	it	tempted	him almost	beyond	endurance.	"How	will	that	do?"	she	demanded,	her	eyes	dancing.

"Oh,	do	look	at	the	cards	and	not	at	me!	You're	a	terrible	person	to	bring shopping,	Peter!"

The	card	selected,	she	had	a	bright	idea.	"What	about	candle-shades?"	she queried.	"We	can't	trust	the	hotel.	I	want	some	with	violets	on	them:	I	love violets."

"Do	you?"	he	said	eagerly.	"That's	just	what	I	wanted	to	know.	Yes,	it's	a	fine idea;	let's	go	and	get	them."

Outside,	she	gave	a	sigh	of	relief,	and	looked	at	the	little	gold	wrist-watch	on	her arm.	"We've	time,"	she	said.	"Take	me	to	tea."

"You	must	know	it's	not	possible,"	he	said.	"They're	enforcing	the	order,	and	one can't	get	tea	anywhere."

She	shook	her	head	at	him.	"I	think,	Peter,"	she	said,	"you'll	never	learn	the ropes.	Follow	me."

Not	literally,	but	metaphorically,	he	followed	her.	She	led	him	to	a	big confectioner's	with	two	doors	and	several	windows,	in	each	of	which	was	a	big notice	of	the	new	law	forbidding	teas	or	the	purchase	of	chocolates.	Inside,	she walked	up	to	a	girl	who	was	standing	by	a	counter,	and	who	greeted	her	with	a smile.	"It	is	cold	outside,"	she	said.	"May	I	have	a	warm	by	the	fire?"

"Certainly,	mademoiselle,"	said	the	girl.	"And	monsieur	also.	Will	it	please	you to	come	round	here?"

They	went	behind	the	counter	and	in	at	a	little	door.	There	was	a	fire	in	the	grate of	the	small	kitchen,	and	a	kettle	singing	on	the	hob.	Julie	sat	down	on	a	chair	at the	wooden	table	and	looked	round	with	satisfaction.

"Why,	it's	all	ready	for	us!"	she	exclaimed.	"Chocolate	cakes,	Suzanne,	please, and	hot	buttered	scones.	I'll	butter	them,	if	you	bring	the	scones."

They	came,	and	she	went	to	the	fire,	splitting	them	open	and	spreading	the	butter lavishly.	"I	love	France,"	she	said.	"All	laws	are	made	to	be	broken,	which	is	all that	laws	are	good	for,	don't	you	think?"

"Yes,"	he	said	deliberately,	glancing	at	the	closed	door,	and	bent	and	kissed	her neck.	She	looked	up	imperiously.	"Again,"	she	said;	and	he	kissed	her	on	the lips.	At	that	she	jumped	up	with	a	quick	return	to	the	old	manner:	"Peter!	For	a parson	you	are	the	outside	edge.	Go	and	sit	down	over	there	and	recollect yourself.	To	begin	with,	if	we're	found,	here,	there'll	be	a	row,	and	if	you're caught	kissing	me,	who	knows	what	will	happen?"

He	obeyed	gaily.	"Chaff	away,	Julie,"	he	said,	"but	I	shan't	wear	black	buttons	at the	dinner.	You'll	have	to	look	out	that	night."

She	put	the	scones	on	the	table,	and	sat	down.	"And	if	I	don't?"	she	queried.

Peter	said	nothing.	He	had	suddenly	thought	of	something.	He	looked	at	her,	and for	the	first	time	she	would	not	meet	his	eyes.

It	was	thought	better	on	New	Year's	Eve	that	they	should	go	separately	to Donovan's	camp,	so	Peter	and	Pennell	set	out	for	it	alone.	By	the	canal Pennell	left	his	friend	to	go	and	meet	Elsie	Harding,	the	third	girl.

Peter	went	on	alone,	and	found	Donovan,	giving	some	orders	in	the	camp.

He	stood	with	him	till	they	saw	the	other	four,	who	had	met	on	the tow-path,	coming	in	together.

"He's	a	dark	horse,"	called	Julie,	almost	before	they	had	come	up,	"and	so's	she.

Fancy	Elsie	being	the	third!	I	didn't	know	they	knew	each	other.	We're	a Colonial	party	to-night,	Jack—all	except	Peter,	that	is,	for	Mr.	Pennell	is	more Canadian	than	English.	We'll	teach	them.	By	the	way,	I	can't	go	on	saying	'Mr.

Pennell'	all	night.	What	shall	I	call	him,	Elsie?"

Peter	saw	that	the	new-comer	wore	an	Australian	brooch,	and	caught	the unmistakable	but	charming	accent	in	her	reply.	"He's	'Trevor'	to	me,	and	he	can be	to	you,	if	you	like,	Julie,"	she	said.

Tommy	sighed	audibly.	"They're	beginning	early,"	she	said;	"but	I	suppose	the rest	of	us	had	better	follow	the	general	example—eh,	Peter?"

In	the	anteroom,	where	tea	was	ready,	Peter	saw	that	Elsie	was	likely	to	play Julie	a	good	second.	She	was	tall,	taller	than	Pennell	himself,	and	dark	skinned, with	black	hair	and	full	red	lips,	and	rather	bigly	built.	It	appeared	that	her	great gift	was	a	set	of	double	joints	that	allowed	her	to	play	the	contortionist	with great	effect.	"You	should	just	see	her	in	tights,"	said	Julie.	"Trevor,	why	didn't you	say	whom	you	were	bringing,	and	I'd	have	made	her	put	them	on.	Then	we could	have	had	an	exhibition,	but,	as	it	is,	I	suppose	we	can't."

"I	didn't	know	you	knew	her,"	he	said.

"You	never	have	time	to	talk	of	other	people	when	you're	together,	I	suppose,"

she	retorted.	"Well,	I've	no	doubt	you	make	the	most	of	your	opportunities,	and you're	very	wise.	But	to-night	you've	got	to	behave,	more	or	less—at	least,	till after	the	coffee.	Otherwise	all	our	preparations	will	be	wasted—won't	they, Peter?"

After	tea	they	set	off	together	for	the	tram-car	that	ran	into	town.	It	was	Julie who	had	decided	this.	She	said	she	liked	to	see	the	people,	and	the	cars	were	so perfectly	absurd,	which	was	true.	Also,	that	it	would	be	too	early	to	enjoy	taxis, the	which	was	very	like	her.	So	they	walked	in	a	body	to	the	terminus,	where	a crowd	of	Tommies	and	French	workmen	and	factory	girls	were	waiting.	The night	was	cloudy	and	a	little	damp,	but	it	had	the	effect	of	adding	mystery	to	the otherwise	ugly	street,	and	to	the	great	ships	under	repair	in	the	dockyards	close

by.	The	lights	of	the	tram	appeared	at	length	round	the	corner,	an	engine-car	and two	trailers.	There	was	a	bolt	for	them.	They	were	packed	on	the	steps,	and	the men	had	to	use	elbows	freely	to	get	the	whole	party	in,	but	the	soldiers	and	the workmen	were	in	excellent	humour,	and	the	French	girls	openly	admiring	of Julie.	In	the	result,	then,	they	were	all	hunched	up	in	the	end	of	a	"first"

compartment,	and	Peter	found	himself	with	his	back	to	the	glass	door,	Julie	on his	right,	Elsie	on	his	left.

"Every	rib	I	have	is	broken,"	said	the	former.

"The	natural	or	the	artificial?"	demanded	Elsie.	"Personally,	I	think	I	broke	a	few of	other	people's."

They	started,	and	the	rattling	of	the	ramshackle	cars	stopped	conversation.	Julie drew	Peter's	attention	to	a	little	scene	on	the	platform	outside,	and	he	looked through	the	glass	to	see	a	big	French	linesman	with	his	girl.	The	man	had	got	her into	a	corner,	and	then,	coolly	putting	his	arms	out	on	either	side	to	the	hand-rail and	to	the	knob	of	their	door,	he	was	facing	his	amorata,	indifferent	to	the	world.

Peter	looked	at	the	girl's	coarse	face.	She	was	a	factory	hand,	bareheaded,	and her	sleeves	were	rolled	up	at	her	elbows.	For	all	that,	she	was	neat,	as	a Frenchwoman	invariably	is.	The	girl	caught	his	gaze,	and	smiled.	The	linesman followed	the	direction	of	her	eyes	and	glanced	friendly	at	Peter	too.	Then	he	saw Julie.	A	look	of	admiration	came	over	his	face,	and	he	put	one	hand	comically	to his	heart.	The	girl	slapped	it	in	a	pretended	fury,	and	Julie	doubled	up	with laughter	in	her	corner.	Peter	bent	over	her.	" 'Everybody's	doing	it,	doing	it,	doing it,' "	he	quoted	merrily.

The	tram	stopped,	in	the	square	before	the	Hôtel	de	Ville.	There	was	a	great	air of	festivity	and	bustle	about	as	they	stepped	out,	for	the	New	Year	is	a	great	time in	France.	Lights	twinkled	in	the	misty	dark;	taxis	sprinted	across	the	open spaces;	and	people	greeted	each	other	gaily	by	the	brightly-lit	shops.	Somehow or	another	the	whole	thing	went	to	Peter's	head	like	wine.	The	world	was	good and	merry,	he	thought	exultantly,	and	he,	after	all,	a	citizen	of	it.	He	caught Julie's	arm,	"Come	on,"	he	called	to	the	others.	"I	know	the	way,"	And	to	her:

"Isn't	it	topping?	Do	you	feel	gloriously	exhilarated?	I	don't	know	why,	Julie,	but I	could	do	anything	to-night."

She	slipped	her	fingers	down	into	his	hand.	"I'm	so	glad,"	she	said.	"So	could	I."

They	whirled	across	the	road,	the	others	after	them,	round	the	little	park	in	the centre	of	the	square,	and	down	an	empty	side-street.	Peter	had	reconnoitred	all approaches,	he	said,	and	this	was	the	best	way.	Begging	him	to	give	her	time	to breathe,	Tommy	came	along	with	Donovan,	and	it	suddenly	struck	Peter	that	the latter	seemed	happy	enough.	He	pressed	Julie's	hand:	"Donovan's	dropped	into step	with	Tommy	very	easily,"	he	said.	"Do	you	mind?"

She	laughed	happily	and	glanced	back.	"You're	as	blind	as	a	bat,	Peter,	when	all's said	and	done,"	she	said;	"but	oh,	my	dear,	I	can't	play	with	you	to-night.	There's only	one	person	I	want	to	walk	with	Peter."

Peter	all	but	shouted.	He	drew	her	to	him,	and	for	once	Julie	was	honestly alarmed.

"Not	now,	you	mad	boy!"	she	exclaimed,	but	her	eyes	were	enough	for	him.

"All	right,"	he	laughed	at	her;	"wait	a	bit.	There's	time	yet."

In	the	little	entrance-hail	the	 maître	d'hôtel	greeted	them.	They	were	the	party	of importance	that	night.	He	ushered	them	upstairs	and	opened	a	door.	The mademoiselles	might	make	the	toilette	there.	Another	door:	they	would	eat	here.

The	men	deposited	their	caps	and	sticks	and	coats	on	pegs	outside,	and	the	girls, who	had	had	to	come	in	uniform	also,	were	ready	as	soon	as	they.	They	went	in together.	Elsie	gave	a	little	whistle	of	surprise.

Peter	had	certainly	done	well.	Holly	and	mistletoe	were	round	the	walls,	and	a big	bunch	of	the	latter	was	placed	in	such	a	way	that	it	would	hang	over	the party	as	they	sat	afterwards	by	the	fire.	In	the	centre	a	silver	bowl	held	glorious roses,	white	and	red,	and	at	each	girl's	place	was	a	bunch	of	Parma	violets	and	a few	sprigs	of	flowering	mimosa.	Bon-bons	were	spread	over	the	white	cloth.

Julie's	candle-shades	looked	perfect,	and	so	did	the	menu-cards.

"I	trust	that	monsieur	is	satisfied,"	said	the	 maître	d'hôtel,	bowing	towards	the man	who	had	had	the	dealings	with	him.	He	got	his	answer,	but	not	from	Peter, and,	being	a	Frenchman,	smiled,	bowed	again,	and	discreetly	left	the	room;	for Elsie,	turning	to	Peter	cried:	"Did	you	do	it—even	the	wattle?"	and	kissed	him heartily.	He	kissed	her	back,	and	caught	hold	of	Julie.	"Tit	for	tat,"	he	said	to	her under	his	breath,	holding	her	arms;	"do	you	remember	our	first	taxi?"	Then, louder:	"Julie	is	responsible	for	most	of	it,"	and	he	kissed	her	too.

They	sorted	themselves	out	at	last,	and	the	dinner,	that	two	of	them	at	least	who were	there	that	night	were	never	to	forget,	began.	They	were	uproariously	merry, and	the	two	girls	who	waited	came	and	went	wreathed	in	smiles.

With	the	champagne	came	a	discussion	over	the	cork.	"Give	it	to	me"	cried Julie;	"I	want	to	wear	it	for	luck."

"So	do	I,"	said	Elsie;	"we	must	toss	for	it."

Julie	agreed,	and	they	spun	a	coin	solemnly.

"It's	mine,"	cried	Elsie,	and	pounced	for	it.

Julie	snatched	it	away,	"No,	you	don't,"	she	said.	"A	man	must	put	it	in,	or	there's no	luck	in	it.	Here	you	are,	Trevor."

Pennell	took	it,	laughing,	and	pushed	back	his	chair.	The	others	stood	up	and craned	over	to	see.	Elsie	drew	up	her	skirt	and	Trevor	pushed	it	down	her stocking	amid	screams	of	laughter,	and	the	rattle	of	chaff.

"No	higher	or	I	faint,"	said	Tommy.

Trevor	stood	up,	a	little	flushed.	"Here,"	said	Peter,	filling	his	glass	with	what was	left	in	the	bottle,	"drink	this,	Pen.	You	sure	want	it."

"It's	your	turn	next,"	said	Trevor,	"and,	by	Jove,	the	bottle's	empty!

Encore	le	vin,"	he	called.

"Good	idea.	It's	Julie's	next	cork,	and	Graham's	the	man	to	do	it."	said Jack	Donovan.	"And	then	it'll	be	your	turn,	Tommy."

"And	yours,"	she	said,	glancing	at	him.

"Bet	you	won't	dare,"	said	Elsie.

"Who	won't?"	retorted	Julie.

"Peter,	of	course."

"My	dear,	you	don't	know	Peter.	Here	you	are,	Peter;	let's	show	them."

She	tossed	the	cork	to	him	and	stood	up	coolly,	put	up	her	foot	on	the	edge	of	the table,	and	lifted	her	skirt.	Peter	pushed	the	cork	into	its	traditional	place	amid cheers,	but	he	hardly	heard.	His	fingers	had	touched	her	skin,	and	he	had	seen the	look	in	her	eyes.	No	wine	could	have	intoxicated	him	so.	He	raised	his	glass.

"Toasts!"	he	shouted.

They	took	him	up	and	everyone	rose	to	their	feet.

"'Here's	to	all	those	that	I	love;

Here's	to	all	those	that	love	me;

Here's	to	all	those	that	love	them	that	love	those

That	love	those	that	love	them	that	love	me!'"

he	chanted.

"Julie's	turn,"	cried	Elsie.

"No,"	she	said;	"they	know	all	my	toasts."

"Not	all,"	said	Donovan;	"there	was	one	you	never	finished—something	about Blighty."

"Rhymes	with	nighty,"	put	in	Tommy	coolly;	"don't	you	remember,	Julie?"

It	seemed	to	Peter	that	he	and	Julie	stood	there	looking	at	each	other	for	seconds, but	probably	no	one	but	Tommy	noticed.	"Take	it	as	read,"	cried	Peter boisterously,	and	emptied	his	glass.	His	example	was	infectious,	and	they	all followed	suit,	but	Donovan	remarked	across	the	table	to	him:

"You	spoiled	a	humorous	situation,	old	dear."

Dinner	over,	they	pushed	the	table	against	the	wall,	and	pulled	chairs	round	the fire.	Dessert,	crackers,	chocolates	and	cigarettes	were	piled	on	a	small	table,	and the	famous	liqueur	came	in	with	the	coffee.	They	filled	the	little	glasses.	"This	is a	great	occasion,"	said	Donovan;	"let's	celebrate	it	properly.	Julie,	give	us	a dance	first."

She	sprang	up	at	once.	"Right-o,"	she	said.	"Clear	the	table."

They	pushed	everything	to	one	side,	and	Peter	held	out	his	hand.	Just	touching

his	fingers,	she	leaped	up,	and	next	minute	circled	there	in	a	whirl	of	skirts.	A piano	stood	in	a	corner	of	the	room,	and	Elsie	ran	to	it.	Looking	over	her shoulder,	she	caught	the	pace,	and	the	notes	rang	out	merrily.

Julie	was	the	very	spirit	of	devilment	and	fun.	So	light	that	she	seemed	hardly	to touch	the	table,	she	danced	as	if	born	to	it.	It	was	such	an	incarnation	of	grace and	music	that	a	little	silence	fell	on	them	all.	To	Peter	she	appeared	to	dance	to him.	He	could	not	take	his	eyes	off	her;	he	cared	nothing	what	others	thought	or saw.	There	was	a	mist	before	him	and	thunder	in	his	ears.	He	saw	only	her flushed,	childlike	face	and	sparkling	brown	eyes,	and	a	wave	of	her	loosened hair	that	slipped	across	them….

The	music	ceased.	Panting	for	breath,	she	leaped	down	amid	a	chorus	of

"Bravo's!"	and	held	out	her	hand	for	the	liqueur-glass.	Peter	put	it	in	her	fingers, and	he	was	trembling	more	than	she,	and	spilt	a	little	of	it.	"Well,	here's	the best,"	she	cried,	and	raised	the	glass.	Then,	with	a	gay	laugh,	she	put	her moistened	fingers	to	his	mouth	and	he	kissed	them,	the	spirit	on	his	lips.

And	now	Elsie	must	show	herself	off.	They	sat	down	to	watch	her,	and	a	more insidious	feeling	crept	over	Peter	as	he	did	so.	The	girl	bent	her	body	this	way and	that;	arched	herself	over	and	looked	at	them	between	her	feet;	twisted herself	awry	and	made	faces	at	them.	They	laughed,	but	there	was	a	new	note	in the	laughter.	An	intense	look	had	come	into	Pennell's	face,	and	Donovan	was lolling	back,	his	head	on	one	side,	smiling	evilly.

She	finished	and	straightened	herself,	and	they	had	more	of	the	liqueur.

Then	Tommy,	as	usual,	remembered	herself.	"Girls,"	she	said,	"we	must	go.

It's	fearfully	late."

Donovan	sat	up.	"What	about	taxis?"	he	demanded.

Peter	went	to	the	door.	"They'll	fetch	them,"	he	said.	"I've	made	an arrangement."

He	went	a	little	unsteadily	to	find	the	 maître	d'hôtel,	and	a	boy	was	despatched, while	he	settled	the	bill.	They	were	tramping	down	the	stairs	as	he	came	out	of the	little	office.	Julie	leading	and	laughing	uproariously	at	some	joke.	Donovan and	Tommy	were	the	steadiest,	and	they	came	down	together.	It	seemed	to	Peter that	it	was	natural	for	them	to	do	so.

Pennell	and	Elsie	got	into	one	taxi.	She	leaned	out	of	the	window	and	waved	her hand.	"We're	the	luckiest,"	she	called;	"we've	the	farthest	to	go.	Good-night everyone,	and	thanks	ever	so	much."

A	second	taxi	came	up.	"Jump	in,	Julie,"	said	Tommy.

She	got	in,	and	Peter	put	his	hand	on	the	door.	"I've	settled	everything, Donovan,"	he	said.	"See	you	to-morrow.	Good-night,	Tommy."

"Good-night,"	she	called	back,	and	he	got	in.	And	next	minute	he	was	alone	with Julie.

In	the	closed	and	darkened	taxi	he	put	his	arm	round	her	and	drew	her	to	him.

"Oh,	my	darling,"	he	murmured.	"Julie,	do	you	love	me	as	I	love	you?	I	can't	live without	you."	He	covered	her	face	with	hot	kisses,	and	she	kissed	him	back.

"Julie,"	he	said	at	length,	breathlessly,	"listen.	My	leave's	come.	I	knew	this morning.	Couldn't	you	possibly	be	in	England	when	I	am?	I	saw	you	first	on	the boat	coming	over—remember?	And	you're	due	again."

"When	do	you	go?"	she	queried.

"Fourteenth,"	he	answered.

She	considered.	"I	couldn't	get	off	by	then,"	she	said,	"but	I	might	the	twenty-first	or	thereabouts.	I'm	due,	as	you	say,	and	I	think	it	could	be	managed."

"Would	you?"	he	demanded,	and	hung	on	her	words.

She	turned	her	face	up	to	him,	and	even	in	the	dark	he	could	see	her	glowing eyes.	"It	would	be	heaven,	Peter,"	she	whispered.

He	kissed	her	passionately.

"I	could	meet	you	in	town	easily,"	he	said.

"Not	the	leave-boat	train,"	she	replied;	"it's	not	safe.	Anyone	might	be	there.	But I'll	run	down	for	a	day	or	two	to	some	friends	in	Sussex,	and	then	come	up	to visit	more	in	town.	I	know	very	few	people,	of	course,	and	all	my	relations	are	in South	Africa.	No	one	would	know	to	whom	I	went,	and	if	I	didn't	go	to	them,

Peter,	why	nobody	would	know	either."

"Splendid!"	he	answered,	the	blood	pounding	in	his	temples.	"I'll	make	all	the arrangements.	Shall	I	take	a	flat,	or	shall	we	go	to	an	hotel?	An	hotel's	more	fun, perhaps,	and	we	can	have	a	suite."

She	leaned	over	against	him	and	caught	his	hand	to	her	breast,	with	a	little	intake of	breath.

"I'll	leave	it	all	to	you,	my	darling,"	she	whispered.

The	taxi	swung	into	the	clearing	before	the	hospital.	"Peter,"	said Julie,	"Tommy's	so	sharp;	I	believe	she'll	suspect	something."

"I	don't	care	a	damn	for	anyone!"	said	Peter	fiercely;	"let	her.	I	only	want	you."





CHAPTER	VI

Peter	secured	his	leave	for	Monday	the	21st	from	Boulogne,	which	necessitated his	leaving	Le	Havre	at	least	twenty-four	hours	before	that	day.	There	were	two ways	of	travelling—across	country	in	a	troop-train,	or	by	French	expresses	via Paris.	He	had	heard	so	much	of	the	latter	plan	that	he	determined	to	try	it.	It	had appeared	to	belong	to	the	reputation	of	the	Church.

His	movement	order	was	simply	from	the	one	port	to	the	other,	and	was probably	good	enough	either	way	round	with	French	officials;	but	there	was	a paper	attached	to	it	indicating	that	the	personnel	in	question	would	report	at	such a	time	to	the	R.T.O.	at	such	a	station,	and	the	time	and	the	station	spelt	troop-train	unmistakably.	Now,	the	troop-train	set	out	on	its	devious	journey	an	hour later	than	the	Paris	express	from	the	same	station,	and	the	hour	of	the	Paris express	corresponded	with	the	time	that	all	decent	officers	go	to	dinner.	Peter therefore	removed	the	first	paper,	folded	it	up	thoughtfully,	and	put	it	in	his pocket.	He	then	reported	to	the	R.T.O.	a	quarter	of	an	hour	before	the	Paris	train started,	and	found,	as	he	expected,	a	N.C.O.	in	sole	charge.	The	man	took	his paper	and	read	it.	He	turned	it	over;	there	was	no	indication	of	route	anywhere.

"Which	train	are	you	going	by,	sir?"	he	asked.

"Paris	mail,"	said	Peter	coolly.	"Will	you	please	put	my	stuff	in	a	first?"

"Certainly,	sir,"	said	the	man,	endorsed	the	order	to	that	effect,	and	shouldered	a suit-case.	Peter	followed	him.	He	was	given	a	first	to	himself,	and	the	Deputy R.T.O.	saw	the	French	inspector	and	showed	him	the	paper.	Peter	strolled	off	and collected	a	bottle	of	wine,	some	sandwiches,	and	some	newspapers;	then	he made	himself	comfortable.	The	train	left	punctually.	Peter	lay	back	in	his	corner and	watched	the	country	slip	by	contentedly.	He	had	grown	up,	had	this	young man.

He	arrived	in	Paris	with	the	dawn	of	Sunday	morning,	and	looked	out	cautiously.

There	was	no	English	official	visible.	However,	his	papers	were	entirely	correct, and	he	climbed	up	the	stairs	and	wandered	along	a	corridor	in	which	hands	and letters	from	time	to	time	indicated	the	lair	of	the	R.T.O.	Arriving,	he	found another	officer	waiting,	but	no	R.T.O.	The	other	was	"bored	stiff,"	he	said;	he had	sat	there	an	hour,	but	had	seen	no	sign	of	the	Transport	Officer.	Peter	smiled, and	replied	that	he	had	no	intention	whatever	of	waiting;	he	only	wanted	to know	the	times	of	the	Boulogne	trains.	These	he	discovered	by	the	aid	of	a railway	guide	on	the	table,	and	selected	the	midnight	train,	which	would	land him	in	Boulogne	in	time	for	the	first	leave-boat,	if	the	train	were	punctual	and the	leave-boat	not	too	early.	In	any	case,	he	could	take	the	second,	which	would only	mean	Victoria	a	few	hours	later	that	same	day.	And	these	details	settled,	he left	his	luggage	in	a	corner	and	strolled	off	into	the	city.

A	big	city,	seen	for	the	first	time	by	oneself	alone	when	one	does	not	know	a soul	in	it,	may	be	intensely	boring	or	intensely	interesting.	It	depends	on	oneself.

Peter	was	in	the	mood	to	be	interested.	He	was	introspective.	It	pleased	him	to watch	the	early	morning	stir;	to	see	the	women	come	out	in	shawls	and	slipshod slippers	and	swill	down	their	bit	of	pavement;	to	see	sleepy	shopkeepers	take down	their	shutters	and	street-vendors	set	up	their	stalls;	to	try	to	gauge	the thoughts	and	doings	of	the	place	from	the	shop-windows	and	the	advertisements.

His	first	need	was	a	wash	and	a	shave,	and	he	got	both	at	a	little	barber's	in which	monsieur	attended	to	him,	while	madame,	in	considerable	 négligée,	made her	toilette	before	the	next	glass.	His	second	was	breakfast,	and	he	got	it, à l'anglaise,	with	an	omelette	and	jam,	in	a	just-stirring	hotel;	and	then,	set	up,	he strolled	off	for	the	centre	of	things.	Many	Masses	were	in	progress	at	the Madeleine,	and	he	heard	one	or	two	with	a	curious	contentment,	but	they	had	no lesson	for	him,	probably	because	of	the	foreign	element	in	the	atmosphere,	and he	did	not	pray.	Still,	he	sat,	chiefly,	and	watched,	until	he	felt	how	entirely	he was	a	stranger	here,	and	went	out	into	the	sun.

He	made	his	way	to	the	river,	and	lingered	there	long.	The	great	cathedral,	with its	bare	January	trees	silhouetted	to	the	last	twig	against	the	clear	sky,	its	massive buttresses,	and	its	cluster	of	smaller	buildings,	held	his	imagination.	He	went	in, but	they	were	beginning	to	sing	Mass,	and	he	soon	came	out.	He	crossed	to	the farther	bank	and	found	a	seat	and	lit	a	pipe.	Sitting	there,	his	imagination	awoke.

He	conceived	the	pageant	of	faith	that	had	raised	those	walls.	Kings	and	lords and	knights,	all	the	glitter	and	gold	of	the	Middle	Ages,	had	come	there—and gone;	Bishops	and	Archbishops,	and	even	Popes,	had	had	their	day	of	splendour there—and	gone;	the	humbler	sort,	in	the	peasant	dress	of	the	period,	speaking

quaint	tongues,	had	brought	their	sorrows	there	and	their	joys—and	gone;	yet	it seemed	to	him	that	they	had	not	so	surely	gone.	The	great	have	their	individual day	and	disappear,	but	the	poor,	in	their	corporate	indistinguishableness	remain.

The	multitude,	petty	in	their	trivial	wants	and	griefs,	find	no	historian	and	leave no	monument.	Yet,	ultimately,	it	was	because	of	the	Christian	faith	in	the compassion	of	God	for	such	that	Notre-Dame	lifted	her	towers	to	the	sky.	The stage	for	the	mighty	doings	of	Kings,	it	was	the	home	of	the	people.	As	he	had seen	them	just	now,	creeping	about	the	aisles,	lighting	little	tapers,	crouched	in	a corner,	so	had	they	always	been.	Kings	and	Bishops	figured	for	a	moment	in pomp	before	the	altar,	and	then	monuments	must	be	erected	to	their	memory.	But it	was	not	so	with	the	poor.	Peter,	in	a	glow	of	warmth,	considered	that	he	was	in truth	one	of	them.	And	Jesus	had	had	compassion	on	the	multitude,	he remembered.	The	text	recalled	him,	and	he	frowned	to	himself.

He	knocked	out	his	pipe,	and	set	out	leisurely	to	find	luncheon.	The	famous book-boxes	held	him,	and	he	bought	a	print	or	two.	In	a	restaurant	near	the Châtelet	he	got	 déjeuner,	and	then,	remembering	Julie,	bought	and	wrote	a picture-postcard,	and	took	a	taxi	for	the	Bois.	He	was	driven	about	for	an	hour	or more,	and	watched	the	people	lured	out	by	the	sun,	watched	the	troops	of	all	the armies,	watched	an	aeroplane	swing	high	over	the	trees	and	soar	off	towards Versailles.	He	discharged	his	car	at	the	Arc	de	Triomphe,	and	set	about deciphering	the	carven	pictures.	Then,	he	walked	up	the	great	Avenue,	made	his way	to	the	Place	de	la	République,	wandered	through	the	gardens	of	the	Louvre, and,	as	dusk	fell,	found	himself	in	the	Avenue	de	l'Opéra.	It	was	very	gay.	He had	a	bock	at	a	little	marble	table,	and	courteously	declined	the	invitations	of	a lady	of	considerable	age	painted	to	look	young.	He	at	first	simply	refused,	and finally	cursed	into	silence,	a	weedy,	flash	youth	who	offered	to	show	him	the sights	of	the	city	in	an	apparently	ascending	scale	till	he	reached	the	final	lure	of a	 cancan,	and	he	dined	greatly	at	a	palace	of	a	restaurant.	Then,	tired,	he	did	not know	what	to	do.

A	girl	passing,	smiled	at	him,	and	he	smiled	back.	She	came	and	sat	down.

He	looked	bored,	she	told	him,	which	was	a	thing	one	should	not	be	in Paris,	and	she	offered	to	assist	him	to	get	rid	of	the	plague.

"What	do	you	suggest?"	he	demanded.

She	shrugged	her	shoulders—anything	that	he	pleased.

"But	I	don't	know	what	I	want,"	he	objected.

"Ah,	well,	I	have	a	flat	near,"	she	said—"a	charming	flat.	We	need	not	be	bored there."

Peter	demurred.	He	had	to	catch	the	midnight	train.	She	made	a	little	gesture; there	was	plenty	of	time.

He	regarded	her	attentively.	"See,	mademoiselle,"	he	said,	"I	do	not	want	that.

But	I	am	alone	and	I	want	company.	Will	you	not	stroll	about	Paris	with	me	for an	hour	or	two,	and	talk?"

She	smiled.	Monsieur	was	unreasonable.	She	had	her	time	to	consider;	she	could not	waste	it.

Peter	took	his	case	from	his	pocket	and	selected	a	note,	folded	it,	and	handed	it to	her,	without	a	word.	She	slipped	it	into	her	bag.	"Give	me	a	cigarette,"	she said.	"Let	us	have	one	little	glass	here,	and	then	we	will	go	on	to	an	'otel	I	know, and	hear	the	band	and	see	the	dresses,	and	talk—is	it	not	so?"

He	could	not	have	found	a	better	companion.	In	the	great	lounge,	later	on, leaning	back	by	his	side,	she	chatted	shrewdly	and	with	merriment.	She described	dresses	and	laughed	at	his	ignorance.	She	acclaimed	certain	pieces, and	showed	a	real	knowledge	of	music.	She	told	him	of	life	in	Paris	when	the Hun	had	all	but	knocked	at	the	gates,	of	the	gaiety	of	relief,	of	things	big	and little,	of	the	flowers	in	the	Bois	in	the	spring.	He	said	little,	but	enjoyed	himself.

Much	later	she	went	with	him	to	the	station,	and	they	stood	outside	to	say	good-bye.

"Well,	little	girl,"	he	said,	"you	have	given	me	a	good	evening,	and	I	am	very grateful.	But	I	do	not	even	know	your	name.	Tell	it	me,	that	I	may	remember."

"Mariette,"	she	said.	"And	will	monsieur	not	take	my	card?	He	may	be	in	Paris again.	He	is	très	agréable;	I	should	like	much	to	content	him.	One	meets	many, but	there	are	few	one	would	care	to	see	again."

Peter	smiled	sadly.	For	the	first	time	a	wistful	note	had	crept	into	her	voice.	He thought	of	others	like	her	that	he	knew,	and	he	spoke	very	tenderly.	"No, Mariette,"	he	said.	"If	I	came	back	I	might	spoil	a	memory.	Good-bye.	God	bless you!"	and	he	held	out	his	hand.	She	hesitated	a	second.	Then	she	turned	back	to

the	taxi.

"Where	would	you	like	to	go?"	he	demanded.

She	leaned	out	and	glanced	up	at	the	clock.	"L'Avenue	de	l'Opéra,"	she	said,	"s'il vous	plait."

The	man	thrust	in	the	clutch	with	his	foot,	and	Mariette	was	lost	to Peter	for	ever	in	the	multitude.

In	Boulogne	he	heard	that	he	was	late	for	the	first	boat,	but	caught	the	second easily.	Remembering	Donovan's	advice,	he	got	his	ticket	for	the	Pullman	at	once, and	was	soon	rolling	luxuriously	to	town.	The	station	was	bustling	as	it	had	done what	seemed	to	him	an	age	before,	but	he	stepped	out	with	the	feeling	that	he was	no	longer	a	fresher	in	the	world's	or	any	other	university.	Declining assistance,	he	walked	over	to	the	Grosvenor	and	engaged	a	room,	dined,	and then	strolled	out	into	Victoria	Street.

It	was	all	so	familiar	and	it	was	all	so	different.	He	stood	aloof	and	looked	at himself,	and	played	with	the	thought.	It	was	incredible	that	he	was	the	Peter Graham	of	less	than	a	year	before,	and	that	he	walked	where	he	had	walked	a score	of	times.	He	went	up	Whitehall,	and	across	the	Square,	and	hesitated whether	or	not	he	should	take	the	Strand.	Deciding	against	it,	he	made	his	way	to Piccadilly	Circus	and	chose	a	music-hall	that	advertised	a	world-famous comedian.	He	heard	him	and	came	out,	still	laughing	to	himself,	and	then	he walked	down	Piccadilly	to	Hyde	Park	Corner,	and	stood	for	a	minute	looking	up Park	Lane.	Hilda	ought	to	come	down,	he	said	to	himself	amusedly.	Then, marvelling	that	he	could	be	amused	at	all	at	the	thought,	he	turned	off	for	his hotel.

It	is	nothing	to	write	down,	but	to	Peter	it	was	very	much.	Everything	was	old, but	everything	was	new	to	him.	At	his	hotel	he	smoked	a	cigarette	in	the	lounge just	to	watch	the	men	and	women	who	came	and	went,	and	then	he	declined	the lift	and	ascended	the	big	staircase	to	his	room.	As	he	went,	it	struck	him	why	it was	that	he	felt	so	much	wiser	than	he	had	been;	that	he	looked	on	London	from the	inside,	whereas	he	had	used	to	look	from	the	outside	only;	that	he	looked with	a	charity	of	which	he	had	never	dreamed,	and	that	he	was	amazingly content.	And	as	he	got	into	bed	he	thought	that	when	next	he	slept	in	town	he would	not	be	alone.	He	would	have	crossed	Tommy's	Rubicon.

Next	morning	he	went	down	into	the	country	to	relations	who	did	not	interest him	at	all;	but	he	walked	and	rode	and	enjoyed	the	English	countryside	with zest.	He	went	to	the	little	country	church	on	the	Sunday	twice,	to	Matins	and Evensong,	and	he	came	home	and	read	that	chapter	of	Mr.	Wells'	book	in	which Mr.	Britling	expounds	the	domestication	of	God.	And	he	had	some	fierce moments	in	which	he	thought	of	Louise,	and	of	Lucienne's	sister,	and	of Mariette,	and	of	Pennell,	and,	last	of	all,	of	Jenks,	and	asked	himself	of	what	use a	domesticated	God	could	be	to	any	of	them.	And	then	on	the	Thursday	he	came up	to	meet	Julie.

It	thrilled	him	that	she	was	in	England	somewhere	and	preparing	to	come	to	him.

His	pulses	beat	so	as	he	thought	of	it	that	every	other	consideration	was temporarily	driven	from	his	mind;	but	presently	he	caught	himself	thinking	what ought	to	be	done,	and	of	what	she	would	be	like.	He	turned	it	over	in	his	mind.

He	had	known	her	in	France,	in	uniform,	when	he	was	not	sure	of	her;	but	now, what	would	she	be	like?	He	could	not	conceive,	and	he	banished	the	idea.	It would	be	more	splendid	when	it	occurred	if	he	had	made	no	imaginary construction	of	it.

His	station	was	King's	Cross,	and	he	took	a	taxi	to	a	big	central	hotel	in	the neighbourhood	of	Regent	Street.	And	as	he	passed	its	doors	they	closed irrevocably	on	his	past.

The	girl	at	the	bureau	looked	up	and	smiled.	"Good-morning,"	she	said.

"What	can	I	do	for	you?	We	are	very	full."

"Good-morning,"	he	replied.	"I	expect	you	are,	but	my	wife	is	coming	up	to town	this	afternoon,	and	we	have	only	a	few	days	together.	We	want	to	be	as central	as	possible.	Have	you	a	small	suite	over	the	week-end?"

"I	don't	know,"	she	said,	and	pulled	the	big	book	toward	her.	She	ran	a	finger down	the	page.	"Four-twenty,"	she	said—"double	bedroom,	sitting-room,	and bathroom,	how	would	that	do?"

"It	sounds	capital,"	said	Peter.	"May	I	go	and	see	it?"

She	turned	in	her	seat,	reached	for	a	key,	and	touched	a	button.	A	man	appeared, soundlessly	on	the	thick,	rich	carpet.	"Show	this	officer	four-twenty,	will	you?"

she	said,	and	turned	to	someone	else.	What	means	so	much	to	some	of	us	is everyday	business	to	others.

Peter	followed	across	the	hall	and	into	a	lift.	They	went	up	high,	got	out	in	a corridor,	took	a	turn	to	the	right,	and	stopped	before	a	door	numbered	420.	The man	opened	it.	Peter	was	led	into	a	little	hall,	with	two	doors	leading	from	it.

The	first	room	was	the	sitting-room.	It	was	charmingly	furnished	and	very	cosy, a	couple	of	good	prints	on	the	walls,	wide	fireplace,	a	tall	standard	lamp,	some delightfully	easy	chairs—all	this	he	took	in	at	a	glance.	He	walked	to	the window	and	looked	out.	Far	below	was	the	great	thoroughfare,	and	beyond	a wilderness	of	roofs	and	spires.	He	stood	and	gazed	at	it.	London	seemed	a different	place	up	there.	He	felt	remote,	and	looked	again	into	the	street.	Its business	rolled	on	indifferent	to	him,	and	unaware.	He	glanced	back	into	the snug	pretty	little	room.	How	easy	it	all	was,	how	secure!	"This	is	excellent,"	he said,	"Show	me	the	bedroom."

"This	way,	sir,"	said,	the	man.

The	bedroom	was	large	and	airy.	A	pretty	light	paper	covered	the	walls,	and	two beds	stood	against	one	of	them,	side	by	side.	The	sun	shone	in	at	the	big	double windows	and	fell	on	the	white	paint	of	the	woodwork,	the	plate-glass	tops	of	the toilet-tables,	and	the	thick	cream-coloured	carpet.	A	door	was	open	on	his	right.

He	walked	across,	and	looked	in	there	too.	A	tiled	bathroom,	he	saw	it	was,	the clean	towels	on	the	highly	polished	brass	rail	heated	by	steam,	the	cork-mat against	the	wall,	the	shower,	douche,	and	spray	all	complete,	even	the	big	cake of	delicious-looking	soap	on	its	sliding	rack	across	the	bath.	He	looked	as	a	man in	a	fairy-story	might	look.	It	was	as	if	an	enchanted	palace,	with	the	princess just	round	the	corner,	had	been	offered	him.	Smiling	at	the	conceit,	he	turned	to the	man.	"I	didn't	notice	the	telephone,"	he	said;	"I	suppose	it	is	installed?"

"In	each	room,	sir,"	said	the	man.

"That	will	do,"	said	Peter.	"It	will	suit	me	admirably.	Have	my	baggage	sent	up, will	you,	and	say	that	I	engage	the	suite.	I	will	be	down	presently."

"Yes,	sir,"	said	the	man,	and	departed.

Peter	went	back	to	the	sitting-room,	and	threw	himself	into	a	chair.	Then	he	had an	idea,	got	up,	went	to	the	telephone,	ordered	a	bottle	of	whisky	to	be	sent	up, and	a	siphon,	and	went	back	to	his	seat.	Presently	he	was	pouring	himself	out	a drink	and	smoking	a	cigarette	on	his	own	(temporary)	hearth-rug.	The	little incident	increased	his	satisfaction.	He	was	reassuring	himself.	Here	he	was

really	safe	and	remote	and	master,	with	a	thousand	servants	and	a	huge	palace	at his	beck	and	call,	and	all	for	a	few	pounds!	It	was	absurd,	but	he	thought	to himself	that	he	was	feeling	civilised	for	the	first	time,	perhaps.

He	looked	round,	and	considered	Julie.	What	would	she	want?	Flowers	to	begin with,	heaps	of	them;	she	liked	violets	for	one	thing,	and	by	hook	or	by	crook	he would	get	a	little	wattle	or	mimosa	to	remind	her	of	Africa.	Then	chocolates	and cigarettes,	both	must	never	be	lacking,	and	a	few	books—no,	not	books, magazines;	and	he	would	have	some	wine	sent	up.	What	else?	Biscuits;	after	the theatre	they	might	be	jolly.	Ah,	the	theatre!	he	must	book	seats.	Well,	a	box would	be	better;	they	did	not	want	to	run	too	great	a	risk	of	being	seen.	Donovan was	quite	possibly	in	town,	to	say	nothing	of—older	friends.	Possibly, considering	the	run	on	the	theatres,	he	had	better	book	up	fairly	completely	for the	days	they	had	together.	But	what	would	she	like?	Julie	would	never	want	to go	if	she	did	not	spontaneously	fancy	a	play.	It	was	a	portentous	question,	and	he considered	it	long.	Finally	he	decided	on	half-and-half	measures,	leaving	some time	free….	Time!	how	did	it	go?	By	Jove!	he	ought	to	make	a	move.	Luncheon first;	his	last	meal	alone	for	some	time;	then	order	the	things;	and	Victoria	at 5.30.	He	poured	himself	another	short	drink	and	went	out.

He	lunched	in	a	big	public	grill-room,	and	chatted	with	a	naval	officer	at	his table	who	was	engaged	in	mine-sweeping	with	a	steam-tramp.	The	latter	was	not vastly	enthusiastic	over	things,	but	was	chiefly	depressed	because	he	had	to report	at	a	naval	base	that	night,	and	his	short	London	leave	was	all	but	run	out.

"Tell	you	what,"	he	said,	"I've	seen	a	good	many	cities	one	way	and	another, from	San	Francisco	to	Singapore,	and	I	know	Paris	and	Brussels	and	Berlin,	but you	can	take	my	word	for	it,	there's	no	better	place	for	ten	days'	leave	than	this same	old	blessed	London.	You	can	have	some	spree	out	East	if	you	want	it,	but you	can	get	much	the	same,	if	not	better,	here.	If	a	fellow	wants	a	bit	of	a	skirt, he	can	get	as	good	a	pick	in	London	as	anywhere.	If	you	want	a	good	show, there	isn't	another	spot	in	the	universe	that	can	beat	it,	whatever	it	is	you	feel like.	If	you	want	to	slip	out	of	sight	for	a	bit,	give	me	a	big	hotel	like	this	in London.	They	don't	damn-well	worry	about	identification	papers	much	here—

too	little,	p'raps,	these	days.	Did	you	hear	of	those	German	submarine	officers who	lived	in	an	hotel	in	Southampton?"

Peter	had;	there	were	few	people	who	hadn't,	seeing	that	the	same	officers	lived in	most	of	the	coast	towns	in	England	that	year;	but	it	is	a	pity	to	damp

enthusiasm.	He	said	he	had	heard	a	little.

"Walked	in	and	out	cool	as	you	please.	When	they	were	drowned	and	picked	up at	sea,	they	had	bills	and	theatre	tickets	in	their	pockets,	and	a	letter acknowledging	the	booking	of	rooms	for	the	next	week!	Fact.	Had	it	from	the fellow	who	got	'em.	And	I	ask	you,	what	is	there	to	prevent	it?	You	come	here:

'Will	you	write	your	name	and	regiment,	please.'	You	write	the	damned	thing—

any	old	thing,	in	fact—and	what	happens?	Nothing.	They	don't	refer	to	them.	In France	the	lists	go	to	a	central	bureau	every	day,	but	here—Lord	bless	you,	the Kaiser	himself	might	put	up	anywhere	if	he	shaved	his	moustache!"

Peter	heard	him,	well	content.	He	offered	a	cigarette,	feeling	warmly	disposed towards	the	world	at	large.	The	naval	officer	took	it.	"Thanks,"	he	said.	"You	in town	for	long?"

"No,"	said	Peter—"a	week	end.	I've	only	just	happened.	What's	worth	seeing?"

"First	and	last	all	the	way, Carminetta.	It's	a	dream.	Wonderful.	By	Gad,	I	don't know	how	that	girl	does	it!	Then	I'd	try	 Zigzag—oh!	and	go	to	 You	Never	Know, You	Know,	at	the	Cri.	Absolutely	toppin'.	A	perfect	scream	all	through.	The	thing at	Daly's'	good	too;	but	all	the	shows	are	good,	though,	I	reckon.	Lumme,	you wouldn't	think	the	war	was	on,	'cept	they	all	touch	it	a	bit! The	Better	'Ole	I	like, but	you	mightn't,	knowing	the	real	thing.	But	don't	miss	 Carminetta	if	you	have to	stand	all	day	for	a	seat	in	the	gods.	Well,	I	must	be	going.	Damned	rough	luck, but	no	help	for	it.	Let's	have	a	last	spot,	eh?"

Peter	agreed,	and	the	drinks	were	ordered.	"Chin-chin,"	said	his	acquaintance.

"And	here's	to	old	London	town,	and	the	Good	Lord	let	me	see	it	again.	It's	less than	even	chances,"	he	added	reflectively.

"Here's	luck,"	said	Peter;	then,	for	he	couldn't	help	it:	"It's	you	chaps,	by	God, that	are	winning	this	war!"

"Oh,	I	don't	know,"	said	the	other,	rising.	"We	get	more	leave	than	you	fellows, and	I'd	sooner	be	on	my	tramp	than	in	the	trenches.	The	sea's	good	and	clean	to die	in,	anyway.	Cheerio."

Peter	followed	him	out	in	a	few	minutes,	and	set	about	his	shopping.	He	found	a florist's	in	Regent	Street	and	bought	lavishly.	The	girl	smiled	at	him,	and suggested	this	and	that.	"Having	a	dinner	somewhere	to-night?"	she	queried.

"But	I	have	no	violets."

"Got	my	girl	comin'	up,"	said	Peter	expansively;	"that's	why	there	must	be violets.	See	if	you	can	get	me	some	and	send	them	over,	will	you?"	he	asked, naming	his	hotel.	She	promised	to	do	her	best,	and	he	departed.

He	went	into	a	chocolate	shop.	"Got	some	really	decent	chocolates?"	he demanded.

The	girl	smiled	and	dived	under	the	counter.	"These	are	the	best,"	she	said, holding	out	a	shovelful	for	Peter	to	taste.	He	tried	one.	"They'll	do,"	he	said.

"Give	me	a	couple	of	pounds,	in	a	pretty	box	if	you've	got	one."

"Two	pounds!"	she	exclaimed.	"What	are	you	thinking	of?	We	can	only	sell	a quarter."

"Only	a	quarter!"	said	Peter.	"That's	no	good.	Come	on,	make	up	the	two pounds."

"If	my	boss	comes	in	or	finds	out	I'll	be	fired,"	said	the	girl;	"can't	be	done."

"Well,	that	doesn't	matter,"	said	Peter	innocently,	"You'll	easily	get	a	job—

something	better	and	easier,	I	expect."

"It's	easy	enough,	perhaps,"	said	the	girl,	"but	you	never	can	tell. And	it's dangerous, and	uncertain."

Peter	stared	at	her.	When	he	bought	chocolates	as	a	parson,	he	never	had	talks like	this.	He	wondered	if	London	had	changed	since	he	knew	it.	Then	he	played up:	"You're	pretty	enough	to	knock	that	last	out,	anyway?"	he	said.

"Am	I?"	she	demanded.	"Do	you	mean	you'd	like	to	keep	me?"

"I've	got	one	week-end	left	of	leave,"	said	Peter.	"What	about	the	chocolates?"

"Poor	boy!"	she	said.	"Well,	I'll	risk	it."	And	she	made	up	the	two	pounds.

He	wandered	into	a	tobacconist's,	and	bought	cigarettes	which	Julie's	soul	loved, and	then	he	made	for	a	theatre	booking-office.

Outside	and	his	business	done,	he	looked	at	his	watch,	and	found	he	had	a	bit	of time	to	spare.	He	walked	down	Shaftesbury	Avenue,	and	thought	he	would	get himself	spruced	up	at	a	hairdresser's.	He	saw	a	little	place	with	a	foreigner	at	the door,	and	he	went	in.	It	was	a	tiny	room	with	three	seats	all	empty.	The	man seated	him	in	one	and	began.

Peter	discovered	that	his	hair	needed	this	and	that,	and	being	in	a	good	temper and	an	idle	mood	acquiesced.	Presently	a	girl	came	in.	Peter	smelt	her	enter,	and then	saw	her	in	the	glass.	She	was	short	and	dark	and	foreign,	too,	and	she	wore a	blouse	that	appeared	to	have	remarkably	little	beneath	it,	and	to	be	about	to	slip off	her	shoulders.	She	came	forward	and	stood	between	him	and	the	glass, smiling.	"Wouldn't	you	like	your	nails	manicured?"	she	demanded.

"Oh,	I	don't	know,"	said	Peter;	"I	had	not	meant	to	…"	and	was	lost.

"Second	thoughts	are	best,"	she	said;	"but	let	me	look	at	your	hands.	Oh,	I should	think	you	did	need	it!	Whatever	will	your	girl	say	to	you	to-night	if	you have	hands	like	this?"

Peter,	humiliated,	looked	at	his	hands.	They	did	not	appear	to	him	to	differ	much from	the	hands	Julie	and	others	had	seen	without	visible	consternation	before, but	he	had	no	time	to	say	so.	The	young	lady	was	now	seated	by	his	side	with	a basin	of	hot	water,	and	was	dabbling	his	hand	in	it.	"Nice?	Not	too	hot?"	she inquired	brightly.

Peter	watched	her	as	she	bent	over	her	work	and	kept	up	a	running	fire	of	talk.

He	gathered	that	many	officers	habitually	were	manicured	by	her,	many	of	them in	their	own	rooms.	It	was	lucky	for	him	that	she	was	not	out.	Possibly	he	would like	to	make	an	appointment;	she	could	come	early	or	late.	No?	Then	she thought	his	own	manicure-set	must	be	a	poor	one,	judging	from	these	hands,	and perhaps	she	could	sell	him	another.	No?	Well,	a	little	cream.	Not	to-day?	He would	look	in	to-morrow?	He	hadn't	a	chance?	She	would	tell	him	what:	where was	he	staying?	(Peter,	for	the	fun	of	it,	told	her	he	had	a	private	suite	in	the hotel.)	Well,	that	was	splendid.	She	would	call	in	with	a	new	set	at	any	time, before	breakfast,	after	the	theatre,	as	he	pleased;	bring	the	cream	and	do	his hands	once	with	it	to	show	him	how.	How	would	that	suit	him?

Peter	was	not	required	to	say,	for	at	that	minute	the	shop-bell	rang	and	a	priest came	in,	a	little	old	man,	tired-looking,	in	a	black	cassock.	He	was	apparently

known,	though	he	seemed	to	take	no	notice	of	anyone.	The	man	was	all	civility, but	put	on	an	expression	meant	to	indicate	amusement,	to	Peter,	behind	the clerical	back.	The	girl	put	one	of	Peter's	fingers	on	her	own	lips	by	way	of directing	caution,	and	continued	more	or	less	in	silence.	The	room	became	all but	silent	save	for	the	sound	of	scissors	and	the	noise	of	the	traffic	outside,	and Peter	reflected	again	on	many	things.	When	he	had	had	his	hair	cut	previously, for	instance,	had	people	made	faces	behind	his	back?	Had	young	ladies	ceased from	tempting	offers	that	seemed	to	include	more	than	manicuring?

He	got	up	to	pay.	"Well,"	she	demanded, sotto	voce,	"what	of	the	arrangement?

She	could	do	him	easily	at	any…"

He	cut	her	short.	No;	it	was	really	impossible.	His	wife	was	coming	up	that afternoon.	It	was	plain	that	she	now	regarded	it	as	impossible	also.	He	paid	an enormous	sum	wonderingly,	and	departed.

Outside	it	struck	him	that	he	had	forgotten	one	thing.	He	walked	briskly	to	the hotel,	and	went	up	to	his	rooms.	In	the	sitting-room	was	the	big	bunch	of	flowers and	a	maid	unwrapping	it.	She	turned	and	smiled	at	him.	"These	have	just	come for	you,	sir,"	she	said.	"Shall	I	arrange	them	for	you?"

"No,	thank	you,"	said	Peter.	"I'd	rather	do	them	myself.	I	love	arranging	flowers, and	I	know	just	what	my	wife	likes.	I	expect	you'd	do	them	better,	but	I'll	have	a shot,	if	you	don't	mind.	Would	you	fill	the	glasses	and	get	me	a	few	more?	We haven't	enough	here."

"Certainly,	sir.	There	was	a	gentleman	here	once	who	did	flowers	beautifully,	he did.	But	most	likes	us	to	do	it	for	them."

She	departed	for	the	glasses.	Peter	saw	that	the	florist	had	secured	his	violets, and	took	them	first	and	filled	a	bowl.	Then	he	walked	into	the	bedroom	and contemplated	for	a	minute.	Then	he	put	the	violets	critically	on	the	little	table	by the	bed	nearest	the	window,	and	stood	back	to	see	the	result.	Finding	it	good,	he departed.	When	next	he	came	in,	it	was	to	place	a	great	bunch	of	roses	on	the mantelshelf,	and	a	few	sprays	of	the	soft	yellow	and	green	mimosa	on	the dressing-table.	For	the	sitting-room	he	had	carnations	and	delphiniums,	and	he placed	a	high	towering	cluster	of	the	latter	on	the	writing-table,	and	a	vase	of	the former	on	the	mantelpiece.	A	few	roses,	left	over,	went	on	the	small	table	that carried	the	reading-lamp,	and	he	and	the	chambermaid	surveyed	the	results.

"Lovely,	I	do	think,"	she	said;	"any	lady	would	love	them.	I	likes	flowers	myself, I	do.	I	come	from	the	country,	sir,	where	there's	a	many,	and	the	wild	flowers	that Jack	and	I	liked	best	of	all.	Specially	primroses,	sir."	There	was	a	sound	in	her voice	as	she	turned	away,	and	Peter	heard	it.

"Jack?"	he	queried	softly.

"'E's	been	missing	since	last	July,	sir,"	she	said,	stopping	by	the	door.

"Has	he?"	said	Peter.	"Well,	you	must	not	give	up	hope,	you	know;	he	may	be	a prisoner."

She	shook	her	head.	"He's	dead,"	she	said,	with	an	air	of	finality.	"I	oughtn't	to have	spoke	a	word,	but	them	flowers	reminded	me.	I'm	glad	as	how	I	have	to	do these	rooms,	sir.	Most	of	them	don't	bother	with	flowers.	Is	there	anything	else you	might	be	wanting,	sir?"

"Light	fires	in	both	the	grates,	please,"	he	said.	"I'm	so	sorry	about Jack,"	he	added.

She	gave	him	a	look,	and	passed	out.

Peter	wandered	about	touching	this	and	that.	Suddenly	he	remembered	the magazines.	He	ran	out	and	caught	a	lift	about	to	descend,	and	was	once	more	in the	street.	Near	Leicester	Square	was	a	big	foreign	shop,	and	he	entered	it,	and gathered	of	all	kinds.	As	he	went	to	pay,	he	saw	 La	Vie	Parisienne,	and	added that	also	to	the	bundle;	Julie	used	to	say	she	loved	it.	Back	in	the	hotel,	he	sent them	to	his	room,	and	glanced	at	his	watch.	He	had	time	for	tea.	He	went	out into	the	lounge	and	ordered	it,	sitting	back	under	the	palms.	It	came,	and	he	was in	the	act	of	pouring	out	a	cup	when	he	saw	Donovan.

Donovan	was	with	a	girl,	but	so	were	most	men;	Peter	could	not	be	sure	of	her.	It was	only	a	glimpse	he	had,	for	the	two	had	finished	and	were	passing	out.

Donovan	stood	back	to	let	her	first	through	the	great	swing-doors,	and	then, pulling	on	his	gloves,	followed.	They	both	disappeared.

Peter	sat	on,	in	a	tumult.	He	had	been	too	busy	all	day	to	reflect	much,	but	now just	what	he	was	about	to	do	began	to	overwhelm	him.	If	Donovan	met	him	with Julie?	Well,	they	could	pretend	they	had	just	met,	they	could	even	part,	and	meet again.	Could	they?	Would	Donovan	be	deceived	for	a	minute?	It	seemed	to	him

impossible.	And	he	might	be	staying	there.	Suppose	he	met	someone	else.

Langton?	Sir	Robert	Doyle?	His	late	Vicar?	Hilda?	Mr.	Lessing?	And	Julie would	have	acquaintances	too.	He	shook	himself	mentally,	and	lit	a	cigarette.

Well,	suppose	they	did;	he	was	finished	with	them.	Finished?	Then,	what	lay ahead—what,	after	this,	if	he	were	discovered?	And	if	he	were	not	discovered?

God	knew….

His	mind	took	a	new	train	of	thought:	he	was	now	just	such	a	one	as	Donovan.

Or	as	Pennell.	As	Langton?	He	wasn't	sure;	no,	he	thought	not;	Langton	kept straight	because	he	had	a	wife	and	kids.	He	had	a	centre.	Donovan	and	Pennell had	not,	apparently.	Well,	he,	Peter	Graham,	would	have	a	centre;	he	would marry	Julie.	It	would	be	heavenly.	They	had	not	spoken	of	it,	of	course,	that night	of	the	dinner,	but	surely	Julie	would.	There	could	be	no	doubt	after	the week-end….	"I	shan't	marry	or	be	given	in	marriage,"	she	had	said.	It	was	like her	to	speak	so,	but	of	course	she	didn't	mean	it.	No,	he	would	marry;	and	then?

He	blew	out	smoke.	The	Colonies,	South	Africa;	he	would	get	a	job schoolmastering?	He	hated	the	idea;	it	didn't	interest	him.	A	farm?	He	knew nothing	about	it—besides,	one	wanted	capital.	What	would	he	do?	What	did	he want	to	do? Want—that	was	it;	how	did	he	want	to	spend	his	life?	Well,	he wanted	Julie;	everything	else	would	fit	round	her,	everything	else	would	be secondary	beside	her.	Of	course.	And	as	he	got	old	it	would	still	be	the	same, though	he	could	not	imagine	either	of	them	old.	But	still,	when	they	did	get	old, his	work	would	seem	more	important,	and	what	was	it	to	be?	Probably	it	would have	to	be	schoolmastering.	Teaching	Latin	to	little	boys—History,	Geography, Mathematics.	He	smiled	ruefully;	even	factors	worried	him.	They	would	hardly want	Latin	and	Greek	much	in	the	Colonies,	either.	Perhaps	at	home;	but	would Julie	stop	at	home?	What	 would	Julie	do?	He	must	ask	her,	sometime	before Monday.	Not	that	night—no,	not	 that	night….

He	ground	his	cigarette	into	his	cup,	and	pushed	his	hands	into	his	pockets,	his feet	out	before	him.	That	night!	He	saw	the	sitting-room	upstairs;	they	would	go there	first.	Then	he	would	suggest	a	dinner	to	her,	in	Soho;	he	knew	a	place	that Pennell	had	told	him	of,	Bohemian,	but	one	could	take	anyone—at	least,	take Julie.	It	would	be	jolly	watching	the	people,	and	watching	Julie.	He	saw	her, mentally,	opposite	him,	and	her	eyes	sparkling	and	alluring.	And	afterwards, warmed	and	fed—why,	back	to	the	hotel,	to	the	sitting-room,	by	the	fire.	They would	have	a	little	supper,	and	then….

He	pictured	the	bedroom.	He	would	let	Julie	go	first.	He	remembered	reading	in a	novel	how	some	newly	married	wife	said	to	the	fellow:	"You'll	come	up	in	half an	hour	or	so,	won't	you,	dear?"	He	could	all	but	see	the	words	in	print.	And	so, in	half	an	hour	or	so,	he	would	go	in,	and	Julie	would	be	in	bed,	by	the	violets, and	he—he	would	know	what	men	talked	about,	sometimes,	in	the	anteroom….

He	recalled	a	red-faced,	coarse	Colonel:	"No	man's	a	man	till	he's	been	all	the way,	I	say…."

And	he	was	a	chaplain,	a	priest.	Was	he?	The	past	months	spun	before	him,	his sermons,	his	talks	to	the	wounded	at	the	hospital,	the	things	he	had	seen,	the stories	he	had	heard.	He	sighed.	It	was	all	a	dream,	a	sham.	There	was	no	reality in	it	all.	Where	and	what	was	Christ?	An	ideal,	yes,	but	no	more	than	an	ideal, and	unrealisable—a	vision	of	the	beautiful.	He	thought	he	had	seen	that	once, but	not	now.	The	beautiful!	Ah!	What	place	had	His	Beauty	in	Travalini's,	in	the shattered	railway-carriage,	in	the	dinner	at	the	Grand	in	Havre	with	Julie?

Julie.	He	dwelt	on	her,	eyes,	hair,	face,	skin,	and	lithe	figure.	He	felt	her	kisses again	on	his	lips,	those	last	burning	kisses	of	New	Year's	Night,	and	they	were all	to	be	his,	as	never	before….	Julie.	What,	then,	was	she?	She	was	his	bride, his	wife,	coming	to	him	consecrate—not	by	any	State	convention,	not	by	any ceremony	of	man-made	religion,	but	by	the	pure	passion	of	human	love,	virginal, clean.	It	was	human	passion,	perhaps,	but	where	was	higher	love	or	greater sacrifice?	Was	this	not	worthy	of	all	his	careful	preparation,	worthy	of	the	one centre	of	his	being?	Donovan,	indeed!	He	wished	he	had	stopped	and	told	him the	whole	story,	and	that	he	expected	Julie	that	night.

He	jumped	up,	and	walked	out	in	the	steps	of	Donovan,	but	with	never	another thought	of	him.	A	boy	in	uniform	questioned	him:	"Taxi,	sir?"	He	nodded,	and the	commissionaire	pushed	back	the	great	swing-door.	He	stood	on	the	steps,	and watched	the	passers-by,	and	the	lights	all	shaded	as	they	were,	that	began	to usher	in	a	night	of	mystery.	His	taxi	rolled	up,	and	the	man	held	the	door	open.

"Victoria!"	cried	Peter,	and	to	himself,	as	he	sank	back	on	the	seat,	"Julie!"





CHAPTER	VII

"Julie!"	exclaimed	Peter,	"I	should	hardly	have	known	you;	you	do	look topping!"

"Glad	rags	make	all	that	difference,	old	boy?	Well,	I	am	glad	you	did	know	me, anyhow.	How	are	you?	Had	long	to	wait?"

"Only	ten	minutes	or	so,	and	I'm	very	fit,	and	just	dying	for	you, Julie."

She	smiled	up	at	him	and	blushed	a	little.	"Are	you,	Peter?	It's	much	the	same here,	my	dear.	But	don't	you	think	we	had	better	get	a	move	on,	and	not	stop	here talking	all	night?"

Peter	laughed	excitedly.	"Rather,"	he	said.	"But	I'm	so	excited	at	seeing	you	that I	hardly	know	if	I'm	on	my	head	or	my	heels.	What	about	your	luggage?	What have	you?	Have	you	any	idea	where	it	is?	There's	a	taxi	waiting."

"I	haven't	much:	a	big	suit-case,	most	important	because	it	holds	an	evening dress—it's	marked	with	my	initials;	a	small	leather	trunk,	borrowed,	with	a	big star	on	it;	and	my	dressing-case,	which	is	here.	And	I	 think	they're	behind,	but	I wouldn't	swear,	because	we've	seemed	to	turn	round	three	times	in	the	course	of the	journey,	but	it	may	have	been	four!"

Peter	chuckled.	She	was	just	the	old	Julie,	but	yet	with	a	touch	of	something more	shining	in	her	eyes,	and	underlying	even	the	simplest	words.

"Well,	you	stand	aside	just	a	moment	and	I'll	go	and	see,"	he	said,	and	he	hurried off	in	the	crowd.

Julie	stood	waiting	patiently	by	a	lamp-stand	while	the	world	bustled	about	her.

She	wore	a	little	hat	with	a	gay	pheasant's	wing	in	it,	a	dark	green	travelling dress	and	neat	brown	shoes,	and	brown	silk	stockings.	Most	people	looked	at	her as	they	passed,	including	several	officers,	but	there	was	a	different	look	in	her brown	eyes	from	that	usually	there,	and	they	all	passed	on	unhesitatingly.

It	seemed	to	her	a	good	while	before	Peter	came	up	again,	in	his	wake	a	railway Amazon	with	the	trunk	on	her	shoulder	and	the	suit-case	in	her	hand.	"Sorry	to keep	you,	dear,"	he	said.	"But	there	was	a	huge	crush	and	next	to	no	porters,	if these	 are	porters.	It	feels	rotten	to	have	a	woman	carrying	one's	luggage,	but	I suppose	it	can't	be	helped.	Come	on.	Aren't	you	tired?	Don't	you	want	tea?"

"I	am	a	little,"	she	said	"And	I	do	a	bit.	Where	are	we	going	to	get	it?	Do	they sell	teas	in	London,	Peter,	or	have	you	taken	a	leaf	out	of	my	book?"

They	laughed	at	the	reminiscence.	"Julie,"	said	Peter,	"this	is	my	outfit,	and	you shall	see	what	you	think	of	it.	Give	me	your	ticket,	will	you?	I	want	to	see	you through	myself."

She	handed	him	a	little	purse	without	a	word,	and	they	set	off	together.	She	was indulging	in	the	feeling	of	surrender	as	if	it	were	not	a	victory	she	had	won,	and he	was	glowing	with	the	sense	of	acquisition,	as	if	he	had	really	acquired something.

Julie	got	into	the	taxi	while	Peter	settled	the	luggage,	gave	directions,	and	paid the	Amazon.	Then	he	climbed	in	and	pulled	the	door	to,	and	they	slipped	out	of the	crowded	station-yard	into	the	roar	of	London.	Julie	put	her	hand	in	his.

"Peter,"	she	said,	"do	tell	me	where	we're	going.	I'm	dying	to	know.	What arrangements	have	you	made?	Is	it	safe?"

He	leaned	over	her,	his	eyes	sparkling.	"A	kiss,	first,	Julie:	no	one will	see	and	it	doesn't	matter	a	damn	if	they	do.	That's	the	best	of London.	My	dear,	I	can	hardly	believe	we're	both	here	at	last,	and	that I've	really	got	you."	Their	lips	met.

Julie	flung	herself	back	with	a	laugh.	"Oh,	Peter,"	she	said,	"I	shall	never	forget that	first	taxi.	If	you	could	have	seen	your	own	face!	Really	it	was	too	comic,	but I	must	say	you've	changed	since	then."

"I	was	a	fool	and	a	beast,"	he	said,	more	gravely;	"I'm	only	just	beginning	to realise	how	much	of	a	fool.	But	don't	rub	it	in,	Julie,	or	not	just	now.	I'm	starting

to	live	at	last,	and	I	don't	want	to	be	reminded	of	the	past."

She	pressed	his	hand	and	looked	out	of	window.	"Where	are	we,	Peter?

Whitehall?	Where	are	we	off	to?"

"I've	got	the	snuggest	little	suite	in	all	London,	darling,"	he	said,	"with	a	fairy palace	at	our	beck	and	call.	I've	been	revelling	in	it	all	day—not	exactly	in	it, you	know,	but	in	the	thought	of	it.	I've	been	too	busy	shopping	to	be	in	much; and	Julie,	I	hope	you	notice	my	hands:	I've	had	a	special	manicure	in	preparation for	you.	And	the	girl	is	coming	round	to-morrow	before	breakfast	to	do	me	again

—or	at	least	she	wanted	to."

"What	are	you	talking	about?	Peter,	what	have	you	been	doing	to-day?"	She sighed	a	mock	sigh.	"Really,	you're	getting	beyond	me;	it's	rather	trying."

Peter	launched	out	into	the	story	to	fill	up	time.	He	really	did	not	want	to	speak of	the	rooms,	that	they	might	give	her	the	greater	surprise.	So	he	kept	going	till the	taxi	stopped	before	the	hotel.	He	jumped	out	gaily	as	the	commissionaire opened	the	door.

"Come	on,"	he	said,	"as	quick	as	ever	you	can."	Then,	to	the	man:	"Have	these sent	up	to	No.	420,	will	you,	please?"	And	he	took	Julie's	arm.

They	went	in	at	the	great	door,	and	crossed	the	wide	entrance-hall.	Everyone glanced	at	Julie,	Peter	noted	proudly,	even	the	girls	behind	the	sweet-counter, and	the	people	waiting	about	as	always.	Julie	held	her	head	high	and	walked more	sedately	than	usual.	She	 was	a	bit	different,	thought	Peter,	but	even	nicer.

He	glowed	at	the	thought.

He	led	her	to	the	lift	and	gave	his	landing	number.	They	walked	down	the corridor	in	silence	and	in	at	their	door.	Peter	opened	the	door	on	the	left	and stood	back.	Julie	went	in.	He	followed	and	shut	the	door	behind	them.

The	maid	had	lit	a	fire,	which	blazed	merrily.	Julie	took	it	all	in—the	flowers, the	pile	of	magazines,	even	the	open	box	of	cigarettes,	and	she	turned enthusiastically	to	him	and	flung	her	arms	round	his	neck,	kissing	him	again	and again.	"Oh,	Peter	darling,"	she	cried,	"I	can't	tell	you	how	I	love	you!	I	could hardly	sit	still	in	the	railway	carriage,	and	the	train	seemed	worse	than	a	French one.	But	now	I	have	you	at	last,	and	all	to	myself.	Oh,	Peter,	my	darling	Peter!"

There	came	a	knock	at	the	door.	Julie	disengaged	her	arms	from	his	neck,	but slipped	her	hand	in	his,	and	he	said,	"Come	in."

The	maid	entered,	carrying	tea.	She	smiled	at	them.	"I	thought	madame	might like	tea	at	once,	sir,"	she	said,	and	placed	the	tray	on	the	little	table.

"Thank	you	ever	so	much,"	said	Julie	impulsively;	"that	is	good	of	you.	I'm longing	for	it.	One	gets	so	tired	in	the	train."	Then	she	walked	to	the	glass.	"I'll take	off	my	hat,	Peter,"	she	said,	"and	my	coat,	and	then	we'll	have	tea comfortably.	I	do	want	it,	and	a	cigarette.	You're	an	angel	to	have	thought	of	my own	De	Reszke."

She	threw	herself	into	a	big	basket	chair,	and	leaned	over	to	the	table.	"Milk	and sugar	for	you,	Peter?	By	the	way,	I	ought	to	know	these	things;	not	that	it	much matters;	ours	was	a	war	marriage,	and	I've	hardly	seen	you	at	all!"

Peter	sat	opposite,	and	watched	her	pour	out.	She	leaned	back	with	a	piece	of toast	in	her	hands,	her	eyes	on	him,	and	they	smiled	across	at	each	other.

Suddenly	he	could	bear	it	no	longer.	He	put	his	cup	down	and	knelt	forward	at her	feet,	his	arms	on	her	knees,	devouring	her.	"Oh,	Julie,"	he	said,	"I	want	to worship	you—I	do	indeed.	I	can't	believe	my	luck.	I	can't	think	that	 you	love me."

Her	white	teeth	bit	into	the	toast.	"You	old	silly,"	she	said.	"But	I	don't	want	to	be worshipped;	I	 won't	be	worshipped;	I	want	to	be	loved,	Peter."

He	put	his	arms	up,	and	pulled	her	head	down	to	his,	kissing	her	again	and	again, stroking	her	arm,	murmuring	foolish	words	that	meant	nothing	and	meant everything.	It	was	she	who	stopped	him.	"Go	and	sit	down,"	she	said,	"and	tell me	all	the	plans."

"Well,"	he	said,	"I	do	hope	you'll	like	them.	First,	I've	not	booked	up	anything for	to-night.	I	thought	we'd	go	out	to	dinner	to	a	place	I	know	and	sit	over	it,	and enjoy	ourselves.	It's	a	place	in	Soho,	and	quite	humorous,	I	think.	Then	we	might walk	back:	London's	so	perfect	at	night,	isn't	it?	To-morrow	I've	got	seats	for	the Coliseum	matinee.	You	know	it,	of	course;	it's	a	jolly	place	where	one	can	talk	if one	wants	to,	and	smoke;	and	then	I've	seats	in	the	evening	for	 Zigzag.	Saturday night	we're	going	to	see	 Carminetta,	which	they	say	is	the	best	show	in	town, and	Saturday	morning	we	can	go	anywhere	you	please,	or	do	anything.	And	we can	cut	out	any	of	them	if	you	like,"	he	added.

She	let	her	arms	lie	along	the	chair,	and	drew	a	breath	of	delight.

"You're	truly	wonderful,"	she	said.	"What	a	blessing	not	having	to	worry what's	to	be	done!	It's	a	perfect	programme.	I	only	wish	we	could	be	in Paris	for	Sunday;	it's	so	slow	here."

He	smiled.	"You're	sure	you're	not	bored	about	to-night?"	he	asked.	She	looked him	full	in	the	eyes	and	said	nothing.	He	sprang	up	and	rushed	towards	her.	She laughed	her	old	gay	laugh,	and	avoided	him,	jumping	up	and	getting	round	the table.	"No,"	she	warned;	"no	more	now.	Come	and	show	me	the	rest	of	the establishment."

Arm	in	arm	they	made	the	tour	of	inspection.	In	the	bathroom	Julie's	eyes danced.	"Thank	the	Lord	for	that	bath,	Peter,"	she	said.	"I	shall	revel	in	it.	That's one	thing	I	loathe	about	France,	that	one	can't	get	decent	baths,	and	in	the country	here	it's	no	better.	I	had	two	inches	of	water	in	a	foot-bath	down	in Sussex,	and	when	you	sit	in	the	beastly	thing	only	about	three	inches	of	yourself get	wet	and	those	the	least	important	inches.	I	shall	lie	in	this	for	hours	and smoke,	and	you	shall	feed	me	with	chocolates	and	read	to	me.	How	will	you	like that?"

Peter	made	the	only	possible	answer,	and	they	went	back	to	the	bedroom.	The man	was	bringing	up	her	luggage,	and	he	deposited	it	on	the	luggage-stool.

"Heavens!"	said	Julie,	"where	are	my	keys?	Oh,	I	know,	in	my	purse.	I	hope	you haven't	lost	it.	Do	give	it	to	me.	The	suit-case	is	beautifully	packed,	but	the	trunk is	in	an	appalling	mess.	I	had	to	throw	my	things	in	anyhow.	By	the	way,	I wonder	what	they'll	make	of	different	initials	on	all	our	luggage?	Not	that	it matters	a	scrap,	especially	these	days.	Besides,	I	don't	suppose	they	noticed."

She	was	on	her	knees	by	the	trunk,	and	had	undone	it.	She	lifted	the	lid,	and Peter	saw	the	confusion	inside,	and	caught	sight	of	the	unfamiliar	clothes,	Julie was	rummaging	everywhere.	"I	know	I've	left	them	behind!"	she	exclaimed.

"Whatever	shall	I	do?	My	scent	and	powder-puff!	Peter,	it's	terrible!	I	can't	go	to Soho	to	dinner	without	them."

"Let's	go	and	get	some,"	he	suggested;	"there's	time."

"No,	I	can't,"	she	said.	"You	go.	Don't	be	long.	I	want	to	sit	in	front	of	the	fire and	be	cosy."

Peter	set	off	on	the	unfamiliar	errand,	smiling	grimly	to	himself.	He	got	the	scent

easily	enough,	and	then	inquired	for	a	powder-puff.	In	the	old	days	he	would scarcely	have	dared;	but	he	had	been	in	France.	He	selected	a	little	French	box with	a	mirror	in	the	lid	and	a	pretty	rosebud	pattern,	and	paid	for	it	unblushingly.

Then	he	returned.

He	opened	the	door	of	their	sitting-room,	and	stood	transfixed	for	a	minute.	The shaded	reading-lamp	was	on,	the	other	lights	off.	The	fire	glowed	red,	and	Julie lay	stretched	out	in	a	big	chair,	smoking	a	cigarette.	She	turned	and	looked	up	at him	over	her	shoulder.	She	had	taken	off	her	dress	and	slipped	on	a	silk	kimono, letting	her	hair	down,	which	fell	in	thick	tumbled	masses	about	her.	The	arm	that held	the	cigarette	was	stretched	up	above	her,	and	the	wide,	loose	sleeve	of	the kimono	had	slipped	back,	leaving	it	bare	to	her	shoulder.	Her	white	frilled petticoat	showed	beneath,	as	she	had	pushed	her	feet	out	before	her	to	the warmth	of	the	fire.	Peter's	blood	pounded	in	his	temples.

"Good	boy,"	she	said;	"you	haven't	been	long.	Come	and	show	me.	I	had	to	get comfortable:	I	hope	you	don't	mind."

He	came	slowly	forward	without	a	word	and	bent	over	her.	The	scent	of	her	rose intoxicatingly	around	him	as	he	bent	down	for	a	kiss.	Their	lips	clung	together, and	the	wide	world	stood	still.

Julie	made	room	for	him	beside	her.	"You	dear	old	thing,"	she	exclaimed	at	the sight	of	the	powder-puff.	"It's	a	gem.	You	couldn't	have	bettered	it	in	Paris."	She opened	it,	took	out	the	little	puff,	and	dabbed	her	open	throat.	Then,	laughing, she	dabbed	at	him:	"Don't	look	so	solemn,"	she	said,	"Solomon!"

Peter	slipped	one	arm	round	her	beneath	the	kimono,	and	felt	her	warm	relaxed waist.	Then	he	pushed	his	other	hand,	unresisted,	in	where	her	white	throat gleamed	bare	and	open	to	him,	and	laid	his	lips	on	her	hair.	"Oh,	Julie,"	he	said,

"I	had	no	idea	one	could	love	so.	It	is	almost	more	than	I	can	bear."

The	clock	on	the	mantelpiece	struck	a	half-hour,	and	Julie	stirred	in	his	arms	and glanced	up.	"Good	Lord,	Peter!"	she	exclaimed,	"do	you	know	what	the	time	is?

Half-past	seven!	I	shall	never	be	dressed,	and	we	shall	get	no	dinner.	Let	me	up, for	goodness	sake,	and	give	me	a	drink	if	you've	got	such	a	thing.	If	not,	ring	for it.	I	shall	never	have	energy	enough	to	get	into	my	things	otherwise."

Peter	opened	the	little	door	of	the	sideboard	and	got	out	decanter,	siphon,	and glasses.	Julie,	sitting	up	and	arranging	herself,	smiled	at	him.	"Is	there	a	single

thing	you	haven't	thought	of,	you	old	dear?"	she	said.

"Say	when,"	said	Peter,	coming	towards	her.	Then	he	poured	himself	out	a tumbler	and	stood	by	the	fire,	looking	at	her.

"It's	a	pity	we	have	to	go	out	at	all,"	he	said,	"for	I	suppose	you	can't	go	like that."

"A	pity?	It's	a	jolly	good	thing.	You	wait	till	you've	seen	my	frock,	my	dear.	But, Peter,	do	you	think	there's	likely	to	be	anyone	there	that	we	know?"

He	shook	his	head.	"Not	there,	at	any	rate,"	he	said.

"Here?"

"More	likely,	but	it's	such	a	big	place	we're	not	likely	to	meet	them,	even	so.	But if	you	feel	nervous,	do	you	know	the	best	cure?	Come	down	into	the	lounge,	and see	the	crowd	of	people.	You	sit	there	and	people	stream	by,	and	you	don't	know a	face.	It's	the	most	comfortable,	feeling	in	the	world.	One's	more	alone	than	on a	desert	island.	You	might	be	a	ghost	that	no	one	sees."

Julie	shuddered.	"Peter	don't!	You	make	me	feel	creepy."	She	got	up	"Go	and find	that	maid,	will	you?	I	want	her	to	help	me	dress."

Peter	walked	to	the	bell	and	rang	it,	"Where	do	I	come	in?"	he	asked.

"Well,	you	can	go	and	wash	in	the	bathroom,	and	if	you're	frightened	of	her	you can	dress	there!"	And	she	walked	to	the	door	laughing.

"I'll	just	finish	my	drink,"	he	said.	"You	will	be	heaps	longer	than	I."

Five	minutes	later,	having	had	no	answer	to	his	ring,	he	switched	off	the	light, and	walked	out	into	the	hall	He	hesitated	at	Julie's	door,	then	he	tapped.	"Come in,"	she	said.

She	was	standing	half-dressed	in	front	of	the	glass	doing	her	hair,	"Oh,	it's	you, is	it?"	she	said.	"Wherever	is	that	maid?	I	can't	wait	all	night	for	her;	you'll	have to	help."

Peter	sat	down	and	began	to	change.	Half-surreptitiously	he	watched	Julie

moving	about,	and	envied	her	careless	abandon.	He	was	much	the	more	nervous of	the	two.

Presently	she	called	him	from	the	bathroom	to	fasten	her	dress.	When	it	was done,	she	stood	back	for	him	to	examine	her.

"That	all	right?"	she	demanded,	putting	a	touch	here	and	there.

Not	every	woman	could	have	worn	her	gown.	It	was	a	rose	pink	with	some	rich flame-coloured	material	in	front,	and	was	held	by	two	of	the	narrowest	bands	on her	shoulders.	In	the	deep	 décolleté	she	pushed	two	rosebuds	from	the	big bunch,	and	hung	round	her	neck	a	pendant	of	mother-of-pearl	and	silver.	She wore	no	other	jewellery,	and	she	needed	none.	She	faced	him,	a	vision	of loveliness.

They	went	down	the	stairs	together	and	out	into	the	crush	of	people,	some	of	the women	in	evening	dress,	but	few	of	the	men.	The	many	uniforms	looked	better, Peter	thought,	despite	the	drab	khaki.	They	had	to	stand	for	awhile	while	a	taxi was	found,	Julie	laughing	and	chatting	vivaciously.	She	had	a	wrap	for	her shoulders	that	she	had	bought	in	Port	Said,	set	with	small	metallic	points,	and	it sparkled	about	her	in	the	blaze	of	light.	She	flattered	him	by	seeming unconscious	of	anyone	else,	and	put	her	hand	on	his	arm	as	they	went	out.

They	drove	swiftly	through	back-streets	to	the	restaurant	that	Peter	had	selected, and	stopped	in	a	quiet,	dark,	narrow	road	off	Greek	Street.	Julie	got	out	and looked	around	with	pretended	fear.	"Where	in	the	world	have	you	brought	me?"

she	demanded.	"However	did	you	find	the	place?	It's	worse	than	some	of	your favourite	places	in	Havre."

Inside,	however,	she	looked	round	appreciatively.	"Really,	Peter,	it's	splendid,"

she	said	under	her	breath—"just	the	place,"	and	smiled	sweetly	on	the	padrone who	came	forward,	bowing.	Peter	had	engaged	a	table,	and	they	were	led	to	it.

"I	had	almost	given	you	up,	sir,"	said	the	man,	"but	by	good	fortune,	some	of	our patrons	are	late	too."

They	sat	down	opposite	to	each	other,	and	studied	the	menu	held	out	to	them	by a	waiter.	"I	don't	know	the	meaning	of	half	the	dishes,"	laughed	Julie.	"You order.	It'll	be	more	fun	if	I	don't	know	what's	coming."

"We	must	drink	Chianti,"	said	Peter,	and	ordered	a	bottle.	"You	can	think	you	are in	Italy."

Elbows	on	the	table	as	she	waited,	Julie	looked	round.	In	the	far	corner	a	gay party	of	four	were	halfway	through	dinner.	Two	officers,	an	elderly	lady	and	a young	one,	she	found	rather	hard	to	place,	but	Julie	decided	the	girl	was	the fiancée	of	one	who	had	brought	his	friend	to	meet	her.	At	other	tables	were mostly	couples,	and	across	the	room	from	her,	with	an	elderly	officer,	sat	a	well-made-up	woman,	very	plainly	 demimonde.	Immediately	before	her	were	four men,	two	of	them	foreigners,	in	morning	dress,	talking	and	eating	hare.	It	was evidently	a	professional	party,	and	one	of	the	four	now	and	again	hummed	out	a little	air	to	the	rest,	and	once	jotted	down	some	notes	on	the	back	of	a programme.	They	took	no	notice	of	anyone,	but	the	eyes	of	the	woman	with	the officer,	who	hardly	spoke	to	her,	searched	Julie	unblushingly.

Julie,	gave	a	little	sigh	of	happiness.	"This	is	lovely,	Peter,"	she	said.	"We'll	be ages	over	dinner.	It's	such	fun	to	be	in	nice	clothes	just	for	dinner	sometimes	and not	to	have	to	worry	about	the	time,	and	going	on	elsewhere.	But	I	do	wish	my friends	could	see	me,	I	must	say.	They'd	be	horrified.	They	thought	I	was	going to	a	stodgy	place	in	West	Kensington.	I	was	must	careful	to	be	vague,	but	that was	the	idea.	Peter,	how	would	you	like	to	live	in	a	suburb	and	have	heaps	of children,	and	dine	out	with	city	men	and	their	wives	once	or	twice	a	month	for	a treat?"

Peter	grimaced.	Then	he	looked	thoughtful.	"It	wouldn't	have	been	any	so remarkable	for	me	at	one	time,	Julie,"	he	said.

She	shook	her	head.	"It	would,	my	dear.	You're	not	made	for	it."

"What	am	I	made	for,	then?"

She	regarded	him	solemnly,	and	then	relaxed	into	a	smile.	"I	haven't	a	notion, but	not	that.	The	thing	is	never	to	worry.	You	get	what	you're	made	for	in	the end,	I	think."

"I	wonder,"	said	Peter.	"Perhaps,	but	not	always.	The	world's	full	of	square	pegs in	round	holes."

"Then	they're	stodgy	pegs,	without	anything	in	them.	If	I	was	a	square	peg	I'd never	go	into	a	round	hole."

"Suppose	there	was	no	other	hole	to	go	into,"	demanded	Peter.

"Then	I'd	fall	out,	or	I	wouldn't	go	into	any	hole	at	all.	I'd	sooner	be	anything	in the	world	than	stodgy,	Peter.	I'd	sooner	be	like	that	woman	over	there	who	is staring	at	me	so!"

Peter	glanced	to	one	side,	and	then	back	at	Julie.	He	was	rather	grave.

"Would	you	really?"	he	questioned.

The	waiter	brought	the	Chianti	and	poured	out	glasses.	Julie	waited	till	he	had gone,	and	then	lifted	hers	and	looked	at	Peter	across	it.	"I	would,"	she	said.	"I couldn't	live	without	wine	and	excitement	and	song.	I'm	made	that	way.	Cheerio, Solomon!"

They	drank	to	each	other.	Then:	"And	love?"	queried	Peter	softly.

Julie	did	not	reply	for	a	minute.	She	set	her	wine-glass	down	and	toyed	with	the stem.	Then	she	looked	up	at	him	under	her	eyelashes	with	that	old	daring	look	of hers,	and	repeated:	"And	love,	Peter.	But	real	love,	not	stodgy	humdrum	liking, Peter.	I	want	the	love	that's	like	the	hot	sun,	and	the	wide,	tossing	blue	sea	east	of Suez,	and	the	nights	under	the	moon	where	the	real	world	wakes	up	and	doesn't go	to	sleep,	like	it	does	in	the	country	in	the	cold,	hard	North.	Do	you	know,"	she went	on,	"though	I	love	the	cities,	and	bands,	and	restaurants,	and	theatres,	and taxis,	and	nice	clothes,	I	love	best	of	all	the	places	where	one	has	none	of	these things.	I	once	went	with	a	shooting-party	to	East	Africa,	Peter,	and	that's	what	I love.	I	shall	never	forget	the	nights	at	Kilindini,	with	the	fireflies	dancing	among the	bushes,	and	the	moon	glistening	on	the	palms	as	if	they	were	wet,	and	the insects	shrilling	in	the	grass,	and	the	hot,	damp	air.	Or	by	day,	up	in	the	forest, camped	under	the	great	trees,	with	the	strange	few	flowers	and	the	silence,	while the	sun	trickled	through	the	leaves	and	made	pools	of	light	on	the	ground.	Do you	know,	I	saw	the	most	beautiful	thing	I've	ever	seen	or,	I	think,	shall	see	in that	forest."

"What	was	that?"	asked	Peter,	under	her	spell,	for	she	was	speaking	like	a woman	in	a	dream.

"It	was	one	day	when	we	were	marching.	We	came	on	a	glade	among	the	trees, and	at	the	end	of	it,	a	little	depression	of	damp	green	grass,	only	the	grass	was quite	hidden	beneath	a	sheet	of	blue—such	blue,	I	can't	describe	it—that quivered	and	moved	in	the	sun.	We	stood	quite	still,	and	then	a	boy	threw	a	little

stone.	And	the	blue	all	rose	in	the	air,	silently,	like	magic.	It	was	a	swarm	of hundreds	and	hundreds	of	blue	butterflies,	Peter.	Do	you	know	what	I	did?	I cried—I	couldn't	help	it.	It	was	too	beautiful	to	see,	Peter."

A	little	silence	fell	between	them.	She	broke	it	in	another	tone.

"And	the	natives—I	love	the	natives.	I	just	love	the	all	but	naked	girls	carrying the	water	up	to	the	village	in	the	evening,	tall	and	straight,	like	Greek	statues; and	the	men,	in	a	string	of	beads	and	a	spear.	I	wanted	to	go	naked	myself	there

—at	least,	I	did	till	one	day	I	tried	it,	and	the	sun	skinned	me	in	no	time.	But	at least	one	needn't	wear	much—cool	loose	things,	and	it	doesn't	matter	what	one does	or	says."

Peter	laughed.	"Who	was	with	you	when	you	tried	the	experiment?"	he demanded.

Julie	threw	her	head	back,	and	even	the	professional	four	glanced	up	and	looked at	her.	"Ah,	wouldn't	you	like	to	know?"	she	laughed.	"Well,	I	won't	tease	you—

two	native	girls	if	you	want	to	know,	that	was	all.	The	rest	of	the	party	were having	a	midday	sleep.	But	I	never	can	sleep	at	midday.	I	don't	mind	lying	in	a hammock	or	a	deck-chair,	and	reading,	but	I	can't	sleep.	One	feels	so	beastly when	one	wakes	up,	doesn't	one?"

Peter	nodded,	but	steered	her	back.	"Tell	me	more,"	he	said.	"You	wake something	up	in	me;	I	feel	as	if	I	was	born	to	be	there."

"Well,"	she	said	reflectively,	"I	don't	know	that	anything	can	beat	the	great	range that	runs	along	our	border	in	Natal.	It's	different,	of	course,	but	it's	very wonderful.	There's	one	pass	I	know—see	here,	you	go	up	a	wide	valley	with	a stream	that	runs	in	and	out,	and	that	you	have	to	cross	again	and	again	until	it narrows	and	narrows	to	a	small	footpath	between	great	kranzes.	At	first	there	are queer	stunted	trees	and	bushes	about,	with	the	stream,	that's	now	a	tiny	thing	of clear	water,	singing	among	them,	and	there	the	trees	stop,	and	you	climb	up	and up	among	the	boulders,	until	you	think	you	can	do	no	more,	and	at	the	last	you come	out	on	the	top."

"And	then?"

"You're	in	wonderland.	Before	you	lies	peak	on	peak,	grass-grown	and	rocky,	so clear	in	the	rare,	still	air.	There	is	nothing	there	but	mountain	and	rock	and	grass,

and	the	blue	sky,	with	perhaps	little	clouds	being	blown	across	it,	and	a	wind that's	cool	and	vast—you	feel	it	fills	everything.	And	you	look	down	the	way you've	come,	and	there's	all	Natal	spread	out	at	your	feet	like	a	tiny	picture, lands	and	woods	and	rivers,	till	it's	lost	in	the	mist	of	the	distance."

She	ceased,	staring	at	her	wine-glass.	At	last	the	chatter	of	the	place	broke	in	on Peter.	"My	dear,"	he	exclaimed,	"one	can	see	it.	But	what	do	you	do	there?"

She	laughed	and	broke	the	spell.	"What	would	one	do?"	she	demanded.	"Eat	and drink	and	sleep,	and	make	love,	Peter,	if	there's	anybody	to	make	love	to."

"But	you	couldn't	do	that	all	your	life,"	he	objected.

"Why	not?	Why	do	anything	else?	I	never	can	see.	And	when	you're	tired—for you	 do	get	tired	at	last—back	to	Durban	for	a	razzle-dazzle,	or	back	farther	still, to	London	or	Paris	for	a	bit.	That's	the	life	for	me,	Peter!"

He	smiled:	"Provided	somebody	is	there	with	the	necessary,	I	suppose?"	he	said.

"Solomon,"	she	mocked,	"Solomon,	Solomon!	Why	do	you	spoil	it	all?	But you're	right,	of	course,	Peter,	though	I	hate	to	think	of	that."

"I	see	how	we're	like,	and	how	we're	unlike,	Julie,"	said	Peter	suddenly,	"You like	real	things,	and	so	do	I.	You	hate	to	feel	stuffy	and	tied	up	in	conventions, and	so	do	I.	But	you're	content	with	just	that,	and	I'm	not."

"Am	I?"	she	queried,	looking	at	him	a	little	strangely.

Peter	did	not	notice;	he	was	bent	on	pursuing	his	argument.	"Yes,	you	are,"	he said.	"When	you're	in	the	grip	of	real	vital	things—nature	naked	and	unashamed

—you	have	all	you	want.	You	don't	stop	to	think	of	to-morrow.	You	live.	But	I,	I feel	that	there	is	something	round	the	corner	all	the	time.	I	feel	as	if	there	must be	something	bigger	than	just	that.	I'd	love	your	forest	and	your	range	and	your natives,	I	think,	but	only	because	one	is	nearer	something	else	with	them	than here.	I	don't	know	how	to	put	it,	but	when	you	think	of	those	things	you	feel	 full, and	I	still	feel	 empty."

"Peter,"	said	Julie	softly,	"do	you	remember	Caudebec?"

He	looked	up	at	her	then.	"I	shall	never	forget	it,	dear,"	he	said.

"Then	you'll	remember	our	talk	in	the	car?"

He	nodded.	"When	you	talked	about	marriage	and	human	nature	and	men,	and so	on,"	he	said.

"No,	I	don't	mean	that.	I	did	talk	of	those	things,	and	I	gave	you	a	little	rather bitter	philosophy	that	is	more	true	than	you	think;	but	I	don't	mean	that.

Afterwards,	when	we	spoke	about	shams	and	playing.	Do	you	remember,	I hinted	that	a	big	thing	might	come	along—do	you	remember?"

He	nodded	again,	but	he	did	not	speak.

"Well,"	she	said,	"it's	come—that's	all."

"Another	bottle	of	Chianti,	sir?"	queried	the	padrone	at	his	elbow.

Peter	started.	"What?	Oh,	yes,	please,"	he	said.	"We	can	manage	another	bottle, Julie?	And	bring	on	the	dessert	now,	will	you?	Julie,	have	a	cigarette."

"If	we	have	another	bottle	you	must	drink	most	of	it,"	she	laughed,	almost	as	if they	had	not	been	interrupted,	but	with	a	little	vivid	colour	in	her	cheeks.

"Otherwise,	my	dear,	you'll	have	to	carry	me	upstairs,	which	won't	look	any	too well.	But	I	want	another	glass.	Oh,	Peter,	do	look	at	that	woman	now!"

Peter	looked.	The	elderly	officer	had	dined	to	repletion	and	drank	well	too.	The woman	had	roused	herself;	she	was	plainly	urging	him	to	come	on	out;	and	as Peter	glanced	over,	she	made	an	all	but	imperceptible	sign	to	a	waiter,	who bustled	forward	with	the	man's	cap	and	stick.	He	took	them	stupidly,	and	the woman	helped	him	up,	but	not	too	noticeably.	Together	they	made	for	the	door, which	the	waiter	held	wide	open.	The	woman	tipped	him,	and	he	bowed.	The door	closed,	and	the	pair	disappeared	into	the	street.

"A	damned	plucky	sort,"	said	Julie;	"I	don't	care	what	anyone	says."

"I	didn't	think	so	once,	Julie,"	said	Peter,	"but	I	believe	you're	right	now.	It's	a topsy-turvy	world,	little	girl,	and	one	never	knows	where	one	is	in	it."

"Men	often	don't,"	said	Julie,	"but	women	make	fewer	mistakes.	Come,	Peter, let's	get	back.	I	want	the	walk,	and	I	want	that	cosy	little	room."

He	drained	his	glass	and	got	up.	Suddenly	the	thought	of	the	physical	Julie	ran through	him	like	fire.	"Rather!"	he	said	gaily.	"So	do	I,	little	girl."

The	waiter	pulled	back	the	chairs.	The	padrone	came	up	all	bows	and	smiles.	He hoped	the	Captain	would	come	again—any	time.	It	was	better	to	ring	up,	as	they were	often	very	full.	A	taxi?	No?	Well,	the	walk	through	the	streets	was enjoyable	after	dinner,	even	now,	when	the	lights	were	so	few.	Good-evening, madame;	he	hoped	everything	had	been	to	her	liking.

Julie	sauntered	across	the	now	half-empty	little	room,	and	took	Peter's	arm	in	the street.	"Do	you	know	the	way?"	she	demanded.

"We	can't	miss	it,"	he	said.	"Up	here	will	lead	us	to	Shaftesbury	Avenue somewhere,	and	then	we	go	down.	Sure	you	want	to	walk,	darling?"

"Yes,	and	see	the	people,	Peter,	I	love	seeing	them.	Somehow	by	night	they're more	natural	than	they	are	by	day.	I	hate	seeing	people	going	to	work	in	droves, and	men	rushing	about	the	city	with	dollars	written	all	across	their	faces.	At night	that's	mostly	finished	with.	One	can	see	ugly	things,	but	some	rather beautiful	ones	as	well.	Let's	cross	over.	There	are	more	people	that	side."

They	passed	together	down	the	big	street.	Even	the	theatres	were	darkened	to some	extent,	but	taxis	were	about,	and	kept	depositing	their	loads	of	men	and smiling	women.	The	street-walks	held	Tommies,	often	plainly	with	a	sweet-heart from	down	east;	men	who	sauntered	along	and	scanned	the	faces	of	the	women; a	newsboy	or	two;	a	few	loungers	waiting	to	pick	up	odd	coppers;	and	here	and there	a	woman	by	herself.	It	was	the	usual	crowd,	but	they	were	in	the	mood	to see	the	unusual	in	usual	things.

In	the	Circus	they	lingered	a	little.	Shrouded	as	it	was,	an	atmosphere	of	mystery hung	over	everything.	Little	groups	that	talked	for	a	while	at	the	corners	or	made appointments,	or	met	and	broke	up	again,	had	the	air	of	conspirators	in	some great	affair.	The	rush	of	cars	down	Regent	Street,	and	then	this	way	and	that,	lent colour	to	the	thought,	and	it	affected	both	of	them.	"What's	brooding	over	it	all, Julie?"	Peter	half-whispered.	"Can't	you	feel	that	there	is	something?"

She	shrugged	her	shoulders,	and	then	gave	a	little	shiver.	"Love,	or	what	men take	for	love,"	she	said.

He	clasped	the	hand	that	lay	along	his	arm	passionately.	"Come	along,"	he	said.

"Oh,	this	 is	good,	Peter,"	said	Julie	a	few	minutes	later.	She	had	thrown	off	her wrap,	and	was	standing	by	the	fire	while	he	arranged	the	cigarettes,	the	biscuits, and	a	couple	of	drinks	on	the	little	table	with	its	shaded	light.	"Did	you	lock	the door?	Are	we	quite	alone,	we	two,	at	last,	with	all	the	world	shut	out?"

He	came	swiftly	over	to	her,	and	took	her	in	his	arms	for	answer.	He	pressed kisses	on	her	hair,	her	lips,	her	neck,	and	she	responded	to	them.

"Oh,	love,	love,"	he	said,	"let's	sit	down	and	forget	that	there	is	anything	but	you and	I."

She	broke	from	him	with	a	little	laugh	of	excitement.	"We	will,	Peter,"	she	said;

"but	I'm	going	to	take	off	this	dress	and	one	or	two	other	things,	and	let	my	hair down.	Then	I'll	come	back."

"Take	them	off	here,"	he	said;	"you	needn't	go	away."

She	looked	at	him	and	laughed	again.	"Help	me,	then,"	she	said,	and	turned	her back	for	him	to	loosen	her	dress.

Clumsily	he	obeyed.	He	helped	her	off	with	the	shimmering	beautiful	thing,	and put	it	carefully	over	a	chair.	With	deft	fingers	she	loosened	her	hair,	and	he	ran his	fingers	through	it,	and	buried	his	face	in	the	thick	growth	of	it.	She	untied	a ribbon	at	her	waist,	and	threw	from	her	one	or	two	of	her	mysterious	woman's things.	Then,	with	a	sigh	of	utter	abandonment,	she	threw	herself	into	his	arms.

They	sat	long	over	the	fire.	Outside	the	dull	roar	of	the	sleepless	city	came faintly	up	to	them,	and	now	and	again	a	coal	fell	in	the	grate.	At	long	last	Peter pushed	her	back	a	little	from	him.	"Little	girl,"	he	said,	"I	must	ask	one	thing.

Will	you	forgive	me?	That	night	at	Abbeville,	after	we	left	Langton,	what	was	it you	wouldn't	tell	me?	What	was	it	you	thought	he	would	have	known	about	you, but	not	I?	Julie,	I	thought,	to-night—was	it	anything	to	do	with	East	Africa—

those	tropical	nights	under	the	moon?	Oh,	tell	me,	Julie!"

The	girl	raised	her	eyes	to	his.	That	look	of	pain	and	knowledge	that	he	had	seen from	the	beginning	was	in	them	again.	Her	hand	clasped	the	lappet	of	his	tunic convulsively,	and	she	seemed	to	him	indeed	but	a	little	girl.

"Peter!	could	you	not	have	asked?	But	no,	you	couldn't,	not	you….	But	you guess	now,	don't	you?	Oh,	Peter,	I	was	so	young,	and	I	thought—oh,	I	thought:

the	big	thing	had	come,	and	since	then	life's	been	all	one	big	mockery.	I've laughed	at	it,	Peter:	it	was	the	only	way.	And	then	you	came	along.	I	haven't dared	to	think,	but	there's	something	about	you—oh,	I	don't	know	what!	But	you don't	play	tricks,	do	you,	Peter?	And	you've	given	me	all,	at	last,	without	a question….	Oh,	Peter,	tell	me	you	love	me	still!	It's	your	love,	Peter,	that	can make	me	clean	and	save	my	soul—if	I've	any	soul	to	save,"	she	added	brokenly.

Peter	caught	her	to	him.	He	crushed	her	so	that	she	caught	her	breath	with	the pain	of	it,	and	he	wound	his	hand	all	but	savagely	in	her	hair.	He	got	up—and she	never	guessed	he	had	the	strength—and	carried	her	out	in	his	arms,	and	into the	other	room.

And	hours	later,	staring	into	the	blackness	while	she	slept	as	softly	as	a	child	by his	side,	he	could	not	help	smiling	a	little	to	himself.	It	was	all	so	different	from what	he	had	imagined.





CHAPTER	VIII

Peter	awoke,	and	wondered	where	he	was.	Then	his	eye	fell	on	a	half-shut, unfamiliar	trunk	across	the	room,	and	he	heard	splashing	through	the	open	door of	the	bathroom.	"Julie!"	he	called.

A	gurgle	of	laughter	came	from	the	same	direction	and	the	splashing	ceased.

Almost	the	next	second	Julie	appeared	in	the	doorway.	She	was	still	half-wet from	the	water,	and	her	sole	dress	was	a	rosebud	which	she	had	just	tucked	into her	hair.	She	stood	there,	laughing,	a	perfect	vision	of	unblushing	natural loveliness,	splendidly	made	from	her	little	head	poised	lightly	on	her	white shoulders	to	her	slim	feet.	"You	lazy	creature!"	she	exclaimed;	"you're	awake	at last,	are	you?	Get	up	at	once,"	and	she	ran	over	to	him	just	as	she	was,	seizing the	bed-clothes	and	attempting	to	strip	them	off.	Peter	protested	vehemently.

"You're	a	shameless	baggage,"	he	said,	"and	I	don't	want	to	get	up	yet.	I	want some	tea	and	a	cigarette	in	bed.	Go	away!"

"You	won't	get	up,	won't	you?"	she	said.	"All	right;	I'll	get	into	bed,	then,"	and she	made	as	if	to	do	so.

"Get	away!"	he	shouted.	"You're	streaming	wet!	You'll	soak	everything."

"I	don't	care,"	she	retorted,	laughing	and	struggling	at	the	same	time,	and	she succeeded	in	getting	a	foot	between	the	sheets.	Peter	slipped	out	on	the	other side,	and	she	ran	round	to	him.	"Come	on,"	she	said;	"now	for	your	bath.	Not another	moment.	My	water's	steaming	hot,	and	it's	quite	good	enough	for	you.

You	can	smoke	in	your	bath	or	after	it.	Come	on!"

She	dragged	him	into	the	bathroom	and	into	that	bath,	and	then	she	filled	a sponge	with	cold	water	and	trickled	it	on	him,	until	he	threatened	to	jump	out and	give	her	a	cold	douche.	Then,	panting	with	her	exertions	and	dry	now,	she collapsed	on	the	chair	and	began	to	fumble	with	her	hair	and	its	solitary	rose.	It

was	exactly	Julie	who	sat	there	unashamed	in	her	nakedness,	Peter	thought.	She had	kept	the	soul	of	a	child	through	everything,	and	it	could	burst	through	the outer	covering	of	the	woman	who	had	tasted	of	the	tree	of	knowledge	of	good and	evil	and	laugh	in	the	sun.

"Peter,"	she	said,	"wouldn't	you	love	to	live	in	the	Fiji—no,	not	the	Fiji,	because I	expect	that's	civilised	these	days,	but	on	an	almost	desert	island?—though	not desert,	of	course.	Why	does	one	call	Robinson	Crusoe	sort	of	islands	 desert?	Oh, I	know,	because	it	means	deserted,	I	suppose.	But	I	don't	want	it	quite	deserted, for	I	want	you,	and	three	or	four	huts	of	nice	savages	to	cut	up	wood	for	the	fire and	that	sort	of	thing.	And	I	should	wear	a	rose—no,	a	hibiscus—in	my	hair	all day	long,	and	nothing	else	at	all.	And	you	should	wear—well,	I	don't	know	what you	should	wear,	but	something	picturesque	that	covered	you	up	a	bit,	because you're	by	no	means	so	good-looking	as	I	am,	Peter."	She	jumped	up	and stretched	out	her	arms,	"Am	I	not	good-looking,	Peter?	Why	isn't	there	a	good mirror	in	this	horrid	old	bathroom?	It's	more	necessary	in	a	bathroom	than anywhere,	I	think."

"Well,	I	can	see	you	without	it,"	said	Peter.	"And	I	quite	agree,	Julie,	you're divine.	You	are	like	Aphrodite,	sprung	from	the	foam."

She	laughed.	"Well,	spring	from	the	foam	yourself,	old	dear,	and	come	and	dress.

I'm	getting	cold.	I'm	going	to	put	on	the	most	thrilling	set	of	undies	this	morning that	you	ever	saw.	The	cami-…	"

Peter	put	his	fingers	in	his	ears.	"Julie,"	he	said,	"in	one	minute	I	shall	blush	for shame.	Go	and	put	on	something,	if	you	must,	but	don't	talk	about	it.	You're	like a	Greek	goddess	just	now,	but	if	you	begin	to	quote	advertisements	you'll	be	like

—well,	I	don't	know	what	you'll	be	like,	but	I	won't	have	it,	anyway.	Go	on;	get away	with	you.	I	shall	throw	the	sponge	at	you	if	you	don't."

She	departed	merrily,	singing	to	herself,	and	Peter	lay	a	little	longer	in	the	soft warm	water.	He	dwelt	lovingly	on	the	girl	in	the	other	room;	he	told	himself	he was	the	happiest	man	alive;	and	yet	he	got	out	of	the	bath,	without	apparent rhyme	or	reason,	with	a	little	sigh.	But	he	was	only	a	little	quicker	than	most men	in	that.	Julie	had	attained	and	was	radiant;	Peter	had	attained—and	sighed.

She	was	entirely	respectable	by	contrast	when	he	rejoined	her,	shaven	and	half-dressed,	a	little	later,	but	just	as	delectable,	as	she	stood	in	soft	white	things

putting	up	her	hair	with	her	bare	arms.	He	went	over	and	kissed	her.	"You	never said	good-morning	at	all,	you	wretch,"	he	said.

She	flung	her	arms	round	his	neck	and	kissed	him	again	many	times.

"Purposely,"	she	said.	"I	shall	never	say	good-morning	to	you	while	you're horribly	unshaven—never.	You	can't	help	waking	up	like	it,	I	know,	but	it's	your duty	to	get	clean	and	decent	as	quickly	as	possible.	See?"

"I'll	try	 always	to	remember,"	said	Peter,	and	stressed	the	word.

She	held	him	for	an	appreciable	second	at	that;	then	loosed	him	with	a	quick movement.	"Go,	now,"	she	said,	"and	order	breakfast	to	be	brought	up	to	our sitting-room.	It	must	be	a	very	nice	breakfast.	There	must	be	kippers	and	an omelette.	Go	quick;	I'll	be	ready	in	half	a	minute."

"I	believe	that	girl	is	sweeping	the	room,"	said	Peter.	"Am	I	to	appear	like	this?

You	must	remember	that	we're	not	in	France."

"Put	on	a	dressing-gown	then.	You	haven't	got	one	here?	Then	put	on	my kimono;	you'll	look	exceedingly	beautiful….	Really,	Peter,	you	do.	Our	island will	have	to	be	Japan,	because	kimonos	suit	you.	But	I	shall	never	live	to	reach	it if	you	don't	order	that	breakfast."

Peter	departed,	and	had	a	satisfactory	interview	with	the	telephone	in	the presence	of	the	maid.	He	returned	with	a	cigarette	between	his	lips,	smiling,	and Julie	turned	to	survey	him.

"Peter,	come	here.	Have	you	kissed	that	girl?	I	believe	you	have!	How	dare	you?

Talk	about	being	shameless,	with	me	here	in	the	next	room!"

"I	thought	you	never	minded	such	things,	Julie.	You've	told	me	to	kiss	girls before	now. And	you	said	that	you'd	always	allow	your	husband	complete	liberty

—now,	didn't	you?"

Julie	sat	down	on	the	bed	and	heaved	a	mock	sigh.	"What	incredible	creatures are	men!"	she	exclaimed.	"Must	I	mean	everything	I	say,	Solomon?	Is	there	no difference	between	this	flat	and	that	miserable	old	hotel	in	Caudebec?	And	last, but	not	least,	have	you	promised	to	forsake	all	other	and	cleave	unto	me	as	long as	we	both	shall	live?	If	you	had	promised	it,	I'd	know	you	couldn't	possibly keep	it;	but	as	it	is,	I	have	hopes."

This	was	too	much	for	Peter.	He	dropped	into	the	position	that	she	had	grown	to love	to	see	him	in,	and	he	put	his	arms	round	her	waist,	looking	up	at	her laughingly.	"But	you	will	marry	me,	Julie,	won't	you?"	he	demanded.

Before	his	eyes,	a	lingering	trace	of	that	old	look	crept	back	into	her	face.	She put	her	hands	beneath	his	chin,	and	said	no	word,	till	he	could	stand	it	no	longer.

"Julie,	Julie,	my	darling,"	he	said,	"you	must."

"Must,	Peter?"	she	queried,	a	little	wistfully	he	thought.

"Yes,	must;	but	say	you	want	to,	say	you	will,	Julie!"

"I	want	to,	Peter,"	she	said—"oh,	my	dear,	you	don't	know,	you	can't	know,	how much.	The	form	is	nothing	to	me,	but	I	want	 you—if	I	can	keep	you."

"If	you	can	keep	me!"	echoed	Peter,	and	it	was	as	if	an	ice-cold	finger	had suddenly	been	laid	on	his	heart.	For	one	second	he	saw	what	might	be.	But	he banished	it.	"What!"	he	exclaimed.	"Cannot	you	trust	me,	Julie?	Don't	you	know I	love	you?	Don't	you	know	I	want	to	make	you	the	very	centre	of	my	being, Julie?"

"I	know,	dearest,"	she	whispered,	and	he	had	never	heard	her	speak	so	before.

"You	want,	that	is	one	thing;	you	can,	that	is	another."

Peter	stared	up	at	her.	He	felt	like	a	little	child	who	kneels	at	the	feet	of	a	mother whom	it	sees	as	infinitely	loving,	infinitely	wise,	infinitely	old.	And,	like	a	child, he	buried	his	head	in	her	lap.	"Oh,	Julie,"	he	said,	"you	must	marry	me.	I	want you	so	that	I	can't	tell	you	how	much.	I	don't	know	what	you	mean.	Say,"	he said,	looking	up	again	and	clasping	her	tightly—"say	you'll	marry	me,	Julie!"

She	sprang	up	with	a	laugh.	"Peter,"	she	said,	"you're	Mid-Victorian.	You	are actually	proposing	to	me	upon	your	knees.	If	I	could	curtsy	or	faint	I	would,	but I	can't.	Every	scrap	of	me	is	modern,	down	to	Venns'	cami-knickers	that	you wouldn't	let	me	talk	about.	Let's	go	and	eat	kippers;	I'm	dying	for	them.	Come on,	old	Solomon."

He	got	up	more	slowly,	half-smiling,	for	who	could	resist	Julie	in	that	mood?

But	he	made	one	more	effort.	He	caught	her	hand.	"But	just	say	'Yes'	Julie,"	he said—"just	'Yes.'"

She	snatched	her	hand	away.	"Maybe	I	will	tell	you	on	Monday	morning,"	she said,	and	ran	out	of	the	room.

As	he	finished	dressing,	he	heard	her	singing	in	the	next	room,	and	then	talking to	the	maid.	When	he	entered	the	sitting-room	the	girl	came	out,	and	he	saw	that there	were	tears	in	her	eyes.	He	went	in	and	looked	sharply	at	Julie;	there	was	a suspicion	of	moisture	in	hers	also.	"Oh,	Peter,"	she	said,	and	took	him	by	the	arm as	the	door	closed,	"why	didn't	you	tell	me	about	Jack?	I'm	going	out immediately	after	breakfast	to	buy	her	the	best	silver	photo-frame	I	can	find, see?	And	now	come	and	eat	your	kippers.	They're	half-cold,	I	expect.	I	thought you	were	never	coming."

So	began	a	dream-like	day	to	Peter.	Julie	was	the	centre	of	it.	He	followed	her into	shops,	and	paid	for	her	purchases	and	carried	her	parcels:	he	climbed	with her	on	to	buses,	which	she	said	she	preferred	to	taxis	in	the	day-time;	he	listened to	her	talk,	and	he	did	his	best	to	find	out	what	she	wanted	and	get	just	that	for her.	They	lunched,	at	her	request,	at	an	old-fashioned,	sober	restaurant	in	Regent Street,	that	gave	one	the	impression	of	eating	luncheon	in	a	Georgian	dining-room,	in	some	private	house	of	great	stolidity	and	decorum.	When	Julie	had	said that	she	wanted	such	a	place	Peter	had	been	tickled	to	think	how	she	would behave	in	it.	But	she	speedily	enlightened	him.	She	drew	off	her	gloves	with	an air.	She	did	not	laugh	once.	She	did	not	chat	to	the	waiter.	She	did	not	hurry	in, nor	demand	the	wine-list,	nor	call	him	Solomon.	She	did	not	commit	one	single Colonial	solecism	at	table,	as	Peter	had	hated	himself	for	half	thinking	that	she might.	Yet	she	never	had	looked	prettier,	he	thought,	and	even	there	he	caught glances	which	suggested	that	others	might	think	so	too.	And	if	she	talked	less than	usual,	so	did	he,	for	his	mind	was	very	busy.	In	the	old	days	it	was	almost just	such	a	wife	as	Julie	now	that	he	would	have	wanted.	But	did	he	want	the	old days?	Could	he	go	back	to	them?	Could	he	don	the	clerical	frock	coat	and	with	it the	clerical	system	and	outlook	of	St.	John's?	He	knew,	as	he	sat	there,	that	not only	he	could	not,	but	that	he	would	not.	What,	then?	It	was	almost	as	if	Julie suggested	that	the	alternative	was	madcap	days,	such	as	that	little	scene	in	the bathroom	suggested.	He	looked	at	her,	and	thought	of	it	again,	and	smiled	at	the incongruity	of	it,	there.	But	even	as	he	smiled	the	cold	whisper	of	dread insinuated	itself	again,	small	and	slight	as	it	was.	Would	such	days	fill	his	life?

Could	they	offer	that	which	should	seize	on	his	heart,	and	hold	it?

He	roused	himself	with	an	effort	of	will,	poured	himself	another	glass	of	wine, and	drank	it	down.	The	generous,	full-bodied	stuff	warmed	him,	and	he	glanced

at	his	wrist-watch.	"I	say,"	he	said,	"we	shall	be	late,	Julie,	and	I	don't	want	to miss	one	scrap	of	this	show.	Have	you	finished?	A	little	more	wine?"

Julie	was	watching	him,	he	thought,	as	he	spoke,	and	she,	too,	seemed	to	him	to make	a	little	effort.	"I	will,	Peter,"	she	said,	not	at	all	as	she	had	spoken	there before—"a	full	glass	too.	One	wants	to	be	in	a	good	mood	for	the	Coliseum.

Well,	dear	old	thing,	cheerio!"

Outside	he	demanded	a	taxi.	"I	must	have	it,	Julie,"	he	said.	"I	want	to	drive	up, and	have	the	old	buffer	in	gold	braid	open	the	door	for	me.	Have	a	cigarette?"

She	took	one,	and	laughed	as	they	settled	into	the	car.	"I	know	the	feeling,	my dear,"	she	said.	"And	you	want	to	stroll	languidly	up	the	red	carpet,	and	pass	by the	pictures	of	chorus-girls	as	if	you	were	so	accustomed	to	the	real	thing	that really	the	pictures	were	rather	borin',	don't	you	know.	And	you	want	to	make eyes	at	the	programme-girl,	and	give	a	half-crown	tip	when	they	open	the	box, and	take	off	your	British	warm	in	full	view	of	the	audience,	and…."

"Kiss	you,"	said	Peter	uproariously,	suiting	the	action	to	the	word.	"Good	Lord, Julie,	you're	a	marvel!	No	more	of	those	old	restaurants	for	me.	We	dine	at	our hotel	to-night,	in	the	big	public	room	near	the	band,	and	we	drink	champagne."

"And	you	put	the	cork	in	my	stocking?"	she	queried,	stretching	out	her	foot.

He	pushed	his	hand	up	her	skirt	and	down	to	the	warm	place	beneath	the	gay garter	that	she	indicated,	and	he	kissed	her	passionately	again.	"It	doesn't	matter now,"	he	said.	"I	have	more	of	you	than	that.	Why,	that's	nothing	to	me	now, Julie.	Oh,	how	I	love	you!"

She	pushed	him	off,	and	snatched	her	foot	away	also,	laughing	gaily.	"I'm	getting cheap,	am	I?"	she	said.	"We'll	see.	You're	going	to	have	a	damned	rotten	time	in the	theatre,	my	dear.	Not	another	kiss,	and	I	shall	be	as	prim	as	a	Quaker."

The	car	stopped.	"You	couldn't,"	he	laughed,	helping	her	out.	"And	what	is	more, I	shan't	let	you	be.	I've	got	you,	old	darling,	and	I	propose	to	keep	you,	what's more."	He	took	her	arm	resolutely.	"Come	along.	We're	going	to	be confoundedly	late."

Theirs	was	a	snug	little	box,	one	of	the	new	ones,	placed	as	in	a	French	theatre.

The	great	place	was	nearly	dark	as	they	entered,	except	for	the	blaze	of	light	that

shone	through	the	curtain.	The	odour	of	cigarette-smoke	and	scent	greeted	them, with	the	rustle	of	dresses	and	the	subdued	sound	of	gay	talk.	The	band	struck	up.

Then,	after	the	rolling	overture,	the	curtain	ran	swiftly	up,	and	a	smart	young person	tripped	on	the	stage	in	the	limelight	and	made	great	play	of	swinging petticoats.

Julie	had	no	remembrance	of	her	promised	severity	at	any	rate.	She	hummed airs,	and	sang	choruses,	and	laughed,	and	was	thrilled,	exactly	as	she	should have	been,	while	the	music	and	the	panorama	went	on	and	wrapped	them	round with	glamour,	as	it	was	meant	to	do.	She	cheered	the	patriotic	pictures	and	Peter with	her,	till	he	felt	no	end	of	a	fellow	to	be	in	uniform.	The	people	in	front	of them	glanced	round	amusedly	now	and	again,	and	as	like	as	not	Julie	would	be discovered	sitting	there	demurely,	her	child's	face	all	innocence,	and	a	big chocolate	held	between	her	fingers	at	her	mouth.	Peter	would	lean	back	in	his corner	convulsed	at	her,	and	without	moving	a	muscle	of	her	face	she	would	put her	leg	tip	on	his	seat	and	push	him.	One	scene	they	watched	well	back	in	their dark	box,	his	arm	round	her	waist.	It	was	a	little	pathetic	love-play	and	well done,	and	in	the	gloom	he	played	with	the	curls	at	her	ears	and	neck	with	his lips,	and	held	her	hand.

When	it	was	over	they	went	out	with	the	crowd.	The	January	day	was	done,	but it	was	bewildering	for	all	that	to	come	out	into	real	life.	There	was	no	romance for	the	moment	on	the	stained	street,	and	in	the	passing	traffic.	The	gold	braid	of the	hall	commissionaire	looked	tawdry,	and	the	pictures	of	ballet-girls	but	vulgar.

It	is	the	common	experience,	but	each	time	one	feels	it	there	is	a	new	surprise.

Julie	had	her	own	remedy:

"The	liveliest	tea-room	you	can	find,	Peter,"	she	demanded.

"It	will	be	hard	to	beat	our	own,"	said	Peter.

"Well,	away	there,	then;	let's	get	back	to	a	band	again,	anyhow."

The	great	palm-lounge	was	full	of	people,	and	for	a	few	minutes	it	did	not	seem as	if	they	would	find	seats;	but	then	Julie	espied	a	half-empty	table,	and	they made	for	it.	It	stood	away	back	in	a	corner,	with	two	wicker	armchairs	before	it, and,	behind,	a	stationary	lounge	against	the	wall	overhung	by	a	huge	palm.	The lounge	was	occupied.	"We'll	get	in	there	presently,"	whispered	Peter,	and	they took	the	chairs,	thankful	in	the	crowded	place	to	get	seated	at	all.

"Oh,	it	was	topping,	Peter,"	said	Julie.	"I	love	a	great	place	like	that.	I	almost wish	we	had	had	dress-circle	seats	or	stalls	out	amongst	the	people.	But	I	don't know;	that	box	was	delicious.	Did	you	see	how	that	old	fossil	in	front	kept looking	round?	I	made	eyes	at	him	once,	deliberately—you	know,	like	this,"	and she	looked	sideways	at	Peter	with	subtle	invitation	just	hinted	in	her	eyes.	"I thought	he	would	have	apoplexy—I	did,	really."

"It's	a	good	thing	I	didn't	notice,	Julie.	Even	now	I	should	hate	to	see	you	look like	that,	say,	at	Donovan.	You	do	it	too	well.	Oh,	here's	the	tea.	Praise	the	Lord!

I'm	dying	for	a	cup.	You	can	have	all	the	cakes;	I've	smoked	too	much."

"Wouldn't	you	prefer	a	whisky?"

"No,	not	now—afterwards.	What's	that	they're	playing?"

They	listened,	Julie	seemingly	intent,	and	Peter,	who	soon	gave	up	the	attempt	to recognise	the	piece,	glanced	sideways	at	the	couple	on	the	lounge.	They	did	not notice	him.	He	took	them	both	in	and	caught—he	could	not	help	it—a	few words.

She	was	thirty-five,	he	guessed,	slightly	made-up,	but	handsome	and	full figured,	a	woman	of	whom	any	man	might	have	been	proud.	He	was	an	officer, in	Major's	uniform,	and	he	was	smoking	a	cigarette	impatiently	and	staring	down the	lounge.	She,	on	the	other	hand,	had	her	eyes	fixed	on	him	as	if	to	read	every expression	on	his	face,	which	was	heavy	and	sullen	and	mutinous.

"Is	that	final,	then,	George?"	she	said.

"I	tell	you	I	can't	help	it;	I	promised	I'd	dine	with	Carstairs	to-night."

A	look	swept	across	her	face.	Peter	could	not	altogether	read	it.	It	was	not merely	anger,	or	pique,	or	disappointment;	it	certainly	was	not	merely	grief.

There	was	all	that	in	it,	but	there	was	more.	And	she	said—he	only	just	caught the	sentence	of	any	of	their	words,	but	there	was	the	world	of	bitter	meaning	in it:

"Quite	alone,	I	suppose?	And	there	will	be	no	necessity	for	me	to	sit	up?"

"Peter,"	said	Julie	suddenly,	"the	tea's	cold.	Take	me	upstairs,	will	you?	we	can have	better	sent	up."

He	turned	to	her	in	surprise,	and	then	saw	that	she	too	had	heard	and	seen.

"Right,	dear,"	he	said,	"It	is	beastly	stuff.	I	think,	after	all,	I'd	prefer	a	spot,	and	I believe	you	would	too."

He	rose	carefully,	not	looking	towards	the	lounge,	like	a	man;	and	Julie	got	up too,	glancing	at	that	other	couple	with	such	an	ordinary	merely	interested	look that	Peter	smiled	to	himself	to	see	it.	They	threaded	their	way	in	necessary silence	through	the	tables	and	chairs	to	the	doors,	and	said	hardly	a	word	in	the lift.	But	in	their	sitting-room,	cosy	as	ever,	Julie	turned	to	him	in	a	passion	of emotion	such	as	he	had	scarcely	dreamed	could	exist	even	in	her.

"Oh,	you	darling,"	she	said,	"pick	me	up,	and	sit	me	in	that	chair	on	your	knee.

Love	me,	Peter,	love	me	as	you've	never	loved	me	before.	Hold	me	tight,	tight, Peter	hurt	me,	kiss	me,	love	me,	say	you	love	me…"	and	she	choked	her	own utterance,	and	buried	her	face	on	his	shoulder,	straining	her	body	to	his,	twining her	slim	foot	and	leg	round	his	ankle.	In	a	moment	she	was	up	again,	however, and	glanced	at	the	clock.	"Peter,	we	must	dress	early	and	dine	early,	mustn't	we?

The	thing	begins	at	seven-forty-five.	Now	I	know	what	we'll	do.	First,	give	me	a drink,	a	long	one,	Solomon,	and	take	one	yourself.	Thanks.	That'll	do.	Here's	the best….	Oh,	that's	good,	Peter.	Can't	you	feel	it	running	through	you	and electrifying	you?	Now,	come"—she	seized	him	by	the	arm—"come	on!	I'll	tell you	what	you've	got	to	do."

Smiling,	though	a	little	astonished	at	this	outburst,	Peter	allowed	himself	to	be pulled	into	the	bedroom.	She	sat	down	on	the	bed	and	pushed	out	a	foot.	"Take	it off,	you	darling,	while	I	take	down	my	hair,"	she	said.

He	knelt	and	undid	the	laces	and	took	off	the	brown	shoes	one	by	one,	feeling her	little	foot	through	the	silk	as	he	did	so.	Then	he	looked	up.	She	had	pulled out	a	comb	or	two,	and	her	hair	was	hanging	down.	With	swift	fingers	she finished	her	work,	and	was	waiting	for	him.	He	caught	her	in	his	arms,	and	she buried	her	face	again.	"Oh,	Peter,	love	me,	love	me!	Undress	me,	will	you?	I want	you	to.	Play	with	me,	own	me,	Peter.	See,	I	am	yours,	yours,	Peter,	all yours.	Am	I	worth	having,	Peter?	Do	you	want	more	than	me?"	And	she	flung herself	back	on	the	bed	in	her	disorder,	the	little	ribbons	heaving	at	her	breast, her	eyes	afire,	her	cheeks	aflame.

"Well,"	said	Peter,	an	hour	or	two	later,	"we've	got	to	get	this	dinner	through	as

quickly	as	we've	ever	eaten	anything.	You'll	have	to	digest	like	one	of	your South	African	ostriches.	I	say,"	he	said	to	the	waitress	in	a	confidential	tone	and with	a	smile,	"do	you	think	you	can	get	us	stuff	in	ten	minutes	all	told?	We're late	as	it	is,	and	we'll	miss	half	the	theatre	else."

"It	depends	what	you	order,"	said	the	girl,	rather	sharply.	Then,	after	a	glance	at them	both:	"See,	if	you'll	have	what	I	say,	I'll	get	you	through	quick.	I	know what's	on	easiest.	Do	you	mind?"

"The	very	thing,"	said	Peter;	"and	send	the	wine-man	over	on	your	way,	will you?	How	will	that	do?"	he	added	to	Julie.

"I'll	risk	everything	to-night,	Peter,	except	your	smiling	at	the	waitress,"	she	said.

"But	I	must	have	that	champagne.	There's	something	about	champagne	that inspires	confidence.	When	a	man	gives	you	the	gold	bottle	you	know	that	he	is really	serious,	or	as	serious	as	he	can	be,	which	isn't	saying	much	for	most	men.

And	not	half	a	bottle;	I've	had	half-bottles	heaps	of	times	at	tête-à-tête	dinners.	It always	means	indecision,	which	is	a	beastly	thing	in	anyone,	and	especially	in	a man.	It's	insulting,	for	one	thing….	Oh,	Peter,	do	look	at	that	girl	over	there.	Do you	suppose	she	has	anything	on	underneath?	I	suppose	I	couldn't	ask	her,	but you	might,	you	know,	if	you	put	on	that	smile	of	yours.	Do	walk	over,	beg	her pardon,	and	say	very	nicely:	'Excuse	me,	but	I'm	a	chaplain,	and	it's	my	business to	know	these	things.	I	see	you've	no	stays	on,	but	have	you	a	bathing	costume?'"

"Julie,	do	be	quiet;	someone	will	hear	you.	You	must	remember	we're	in England,	and	that	you're	talking	English."

"I	don't	care	a	damn	if	they	do,	Peter!	Oh,	here's	the	champagne,	at	any	rate.	Oh, and	some	soup.	Well,	that's	something."

"I've	got	the	fish	coming,"	said	the	girl,	"if	you	can	be	ready	at	once."

Julie	seized	her	spoon.	"I	suppose	I	mustn't	drink	it?"	she	said.	"I	don't	see	why	I shouldn't,	as	a	matter	of	fact,	but	it	might	reflect	on	you,	Peter,	and	you're looking	so	immaculate	to-night.	By	the	way,	you've	never	had	that	manicure.	Do send	a	note	for	the	girl.	I'd	hide	in	the	bathroom.	I'd	love	to	hear	you.	Peter,	if	I only	thought	you	would	do	it,	I'd	like	it	better	than	the	play.	What	is	the	play,	by the	way? Zigzag? 	Oh, Zigzag"	(She	mimicked	in	a	French	accent.)	"Well,	it	will be	all	too	sadly	true	if	I	leave	you	to	that	bottle	of	fizz	all	by	yourself.	Give	me another	glass,	please."

"What	about	you?"	demanded	Peter.	"If	you're	like	this	now,	Heaven	knows	what you'll	be	by	the	time	you've	had	half	of	this."

"Peter,	you're	an	ignoramus.	Girls	like	me	never	take	too	much.	We	began	early for	one	thing,	and	we're	used	to	it.	For	another,	the	more	a	girl	talks,	the	soberer she	is.	She	talks	because	she's	thinking,	and	because	she	doesn't	want	the	man	to talk.	Now,	if	you	talked	to-night,	I	don't	know	what	you	might	not	say.	You'd probably	be	enormously	sentimental,	and	I	hate	sentimental	people.	I	do,	really.

Sentiment	is	wishy-washy,	isn't	it?	I	always	associate	it	with	comedians	on	the stage.	Look	over	there.	Do	you	see	that	girl	in	the	big	droopy	hat	and	the	thin hands?	And	the	boy—one	must	say	'boy,'	I	suppose?	He's	a	little	fat	and	slightly bald,	and	he's	got	three	pips	up,	and	has	had	them	for	a	long	time.	Well,	look	at them.	He's	searching	her	eyes,	he	is,	Peter,	really.	That's	how	it's	done:	you	just watch.	And	he	doesn't	know	if	he's	eating	pea-soup	or	oyster-sauce.	And	she's hoping	her	hat	is	drooping	just	right,	and	that	he'll	notice	her	ring	is	on	the wrong	finger,	and	how	nice	one	would	look	in	the	right	place.	To	do	her	justice, she	isn't	thinking	much	about	dinner,	either;	but	that's	sinful	waste,	Peter,	in	the first	place,	and	bad	for	one's	tummy	in	the	second.	However,	they're	sentimental, they	are,	and	there's	a	fortune	in	it.	If	they	could	only	bring	themselves	to	do	just that	for	fifteen	minutes	at	the	Alhambra	every	night,	they'd	be	the	most	popular turn	in	London."

"That's	all	very	well,"	said	he;	"but	if	you	eat	so	fast	and	talk	at	the	same	time, you'll	pay	for	it	very	much	as	you	think	they	will.	Have	you	finished?"

"No,	I	haven't.	I	want	cheese-straws,	and	I	shall	sit	here	till	I	get	them	or	till	the whole	of	London	zigzags	round	me."

"I	say,"	said	Peter	to	their	waitress,	"if	you	possibly	can,	fetch	us	cheese-straws now.	Not	too	many,	but	quickly.	Can	you?	The	lady	won't	go	without	them,	and something	must	be	done."

"Wouldn't	the	management	wait	if	you	telephoned,	Peter	dear?"	inquired	Julie sarcastically.	"Just	say	who	you	are,	and	they	sure	will.	If	the	chorus	only	knew, they'd	go	on	strike	against	appearing	before	you	came,	or	tear	their	tights	or something	dreadful	like	that,	so	that	they	couldn't	come	on.	Yes,	now	I	am	ready.

One	wee	last	little	drop	of	the	bubbly—I	see	it	there—and	I'll	sacrifice	coffee	for your	sake.	Give	me	a	cigarette,	though.	Thanks.	And	now	my	wrap."

She	rose,	the	cigarette	in	her	fingers,	smiling	at	him.	Peter	hastily	followed, walking	on	air.	He	was	beginning	to	realise	how	often	he	failed	to	understand Julie,	and	to	see	how	completely	she	controlled	her	apparently	more	frivolous moods;	but	he	loved	her	in	them.	He	little	knew,	as	he	followed	her	out,	the tumult	of	thoughts	that	raced	through	that	little	head	with	its	wealth	of	brown hair.	He	little	guessed	how	bravely	she	was	already	counting	the	fleeting minutes,	how	resolutely	keeping	grip	of	herself	in	the	flood	which	threatened	to sweep	her—how	gladly!—away.

A	good	revue	must	be	a	pageant	of	music,	colour,	scenery,	song,	dance,	humour, and	the	impossible.	There	must	be	good	songs	in	it,	but	one	does	not	go	for	the songs,	any	more	than	one	goes	to	see	the	working	out	of	a	plot.	Strung-up	men, forty-eight	hours	out	of	the	trenches,	with	every	nerve	on	edge,	must	come	away with	a	smile	of	satisfaction	on	their	faces,	to	have	a	last	drink	at	home	and	sleep like	babies.	Women	who	have	been	on	nervous	tension	for	months	must	be	able to	go	there,	and	allow	their	tired	senses	to	drink	in	the	feast	of	it	all,	so	that	they too	may	go	home	and	sleep.	And	in	a	sense	their	evening	meant	all	this	to	Peter and	Julie;	but	only	in	a	sense.

They	both	of	them	bathed	in	the	performance.	The	possible	and	impossible scenes	came	and	went	in	a	bewildering	variety,	till	one	had	the	feeling	that	one was	asleep	and	dreaming	the	incomprehensible	jumble	of	a	dream,	and,	as	in	a nice	dream,	one	knew	it	was	absurd,	but	did	not	care.	The	magnificent,	brilliant staging	dazzled	till	one	lay	back	in	one's	chair	and	refused	to	name	the	colours	to oneself	or	admire	their	blending	any	more.	The	chorus-girls	trooped	on	and	off till	they	seemed	countless,	and	one	abandoned	any	wish	to	pick	the	prettiest	and follow	her	through.	And	the	gay	palace	of	luxury,	with	its	hundreds	of	splendidly dressed	women,	its	men	in	uniform,	its	height	and	width	and	gold	and	painting, and	its	great	arching	roof,	where,	high	above,	the	stirring	of	human	hearts	still went	on,	took	to	itself	an	atmosphere	and	became	sentient	with	humanity.

Julie	and	Peter	were	both	emotional	and	imaginative,	and	they	were	spellbound till	the	notes	of	the	National	Anthem	roused	them.	Then,	with	the	commonplaces of	departure,	they	left	the	place.	"It's	so	near,"	said	Julie	in	the	crowd	outside;

"let's	walk	again."

"The	other	pavement,	then,"	said	Peter,	and	they	crossed.	It	was	cold,	and	Julie clung	to	him,	and	they	walked	swiftly.

At	the	entrance	Peter	suggested	an	hour	under	the	palms,	but	Julie	pleaded against	it.	"Why,	dear?"	she	said.	"It's	so	cosy	upstairs,	and	we	have	all	we	want.

Besides,	the	lounge	would	be	an	anti-climax;	let's	go	up."

They	went	up,	and	Julie	dropped	into	her	chair	while	Peter	knelt	to	poke	the	fire.

Then	he	lit	a	cigarette,	and	she	refused	one	for	once,	and	he	stood	there	looking into	the	flame.

Julie	drew	a	deep	sigh.	"Wasn't	it	gorgeous,	Peter?"	she	said.	"I	can't	help	it,	but	I always	feel	I	want	it	to	go	on	for	ever	and	ever.	Did	you	ever	see	 Kismet? 	That was	worse	even	than	this.	I	wanted	to	get	up	and	walk	into	the	play.	These modern	things	are	too	clever;	you	know	they're	unreal,	and	yet	they	seem	to	be real.	You	know	you're	dreaming,	but	you	hate	to	wake	up.	I	could	let	all	that music	and	dancing	and	colour	go	on	round	me	till	I	floated	away	and	away,	for ever."

Peter	said	nothing.	He	continued	to	stare	into	the	fire.

"What	do	you	feel?"	demanded	Julie.

Peter	drew	hard	on	his	cigarette,	and	then	he	blew	out	the	smoke.	"I	don't	know,"

he	said.	"Yes,	I	do,"	he	added	quickly;	"I	feel	I	want	to	get	up	and	preach	a sermon."

"Good	Lord,	Peter!	what	a	dreadful	sensation	that	must	be!	Don't	begin	now,	will you?	I'm	beginning	to	wish	we'd	gone	into	the	lounge	after	all;	you	surely couldn't	have	preached	there."

Peter	did	not	smile.	He	went	on	as	if	she	had	not	spoken,	"Or	write	a	great	novel, or,	better	still,	a	great	play,"	he	said.

"What	would	be	the	subject,	then,	you	Solomon,	or	the	title,	anyway?"

"I	don't	know,"	said	Peter	dreamily.	" All	Men	are	Grass, The	Way	of	all	Flesh—

no,	neither	of	those	is	good,	and	besides,	one	at	least	is	taken.	I	know,"	he	added suddenly,	"I	would	call	it	 Exchange,	that's	all.	My	word,	Julie,	I	believe	I	could do	it."	He	straightened	himself,	and	walked	across	the	room	and	back	again, once	or	twice.	"I	believe	I	could:	I	feel	it	tingling	in	me;	but	it's	all	formless,	if you	understand;	I've	no	plot.	It's	just	what	I	feel	as	I	sit	there	in	a	theatre,	as	we did	just	now."

Julie	leaned	forward	and	took	the	cigarette	she	had	just	refused.	She	lit	it	herself with	a	half-burnt	match,	and	Peter	stood	and	watched	her,	but	hardly	saw	what she	was	doing.	She	was	as	conscious	of	his	preoccupation	as	if	it	were something	physical	about	him.

"Explain,	my	dear,"	she	said,	leaning	back	and	staring	into	the	fire.

"I	don't	know	that	I	can,"	he	replied,	and	she	felt	as	if	he	did	not	speak	to	her.

"It's	the	bigness	of	it	all,	the	beauty,	the	triumphant	success.	It's	drawn	that	great house	full,	lured	them	in,	the	thousands	of	them,	and	it	does	so	night	after	night.

Tired	people	go	there	to	be	refreshed,	and	sad	people	to	be	made	gay,	and	people sick	of	life	to	laugh	and	forget	it.	It's	the	world's	big	anodyne.	It	offers	a	great exchange.	And	all	for	a	few	shillings,	Julie,	and	for	a	few	hours.	The	sensation lingers,	but	one	has	to	go	again	and	again.	It	tricks	one	into	thinking,	almost,	that it's	the	real	thing,	that	one	can	dance	like	mayflies	in	the	sun.	Only,	Julie,	there comes	an	hour	when	down	sinks	the	sun,	and	what	of	the	mayflies	then?"

Julie	shifted	her	head	ever	so	little.	"Go	on,"	she	said,	looking	up	intently	at	him.

He	did	not	notice	her,	but	her	words	roused	him.	He	began	to	pace	up	and	down again,	and	her	eyes	followed	him.	"Why,"	he	said	excitedly,	"don't	you	see	that it's	a	fraudulent	exchange?	It's	a	fraudulent	exchange	that	it	offers,	and	it	itself	is an	exchange	as	fraudulent	as	that	which	our	modern	world	is	making.	No,	not our	modern	world	only.	We	talk	so	big	of	our	modernity,	when	it's	all	less	than the	dust—this	year's	leaves,	no	better	than	last	year's,	and	fallen	to-morrow.

Rome	offered	the	same	exchange,	and	even	a	better	one,	I	think—the	blood	and lust	and	conflict	of	the	amphitheatre.	But	they're	both	exchanges,	offered	instead of	the	great	thing,	the	only	great	thing."

"Which	is,	Peter?"

"God,	of	course—Almighty	God;	Jesus,	if	you	will,	but	I'm	not	in	a	mood	for	the tenderness	of	that.	It's	God	Himself	Who	offers	tired	and	sad	people,	and	people sick	of	life,	no	anodyne,	no	mere	rest,	but	stir	and	fight	and	the	thrill	of	things nobly	done—nobly	tried,	Julie,	even	if	nobly	failed.	Can't	you	see	it?	And	you and	I	to-night	have	been	looking	at	what	the	world	offers—in	exchange."

He	ceased	and	dropped	into	a	chair	the	other	side	of	the	fire.	A	silence	fell	on them.	Then	Julie	gave	a	little	shiver.	"Peter,	dear,"	she	said	tenderly,	"I'm	a	little tired	and	cold."

He	was	up	at	once	and	bending	over	her.	"My	darling,	what	a	beast	I	am!	I	clean forgot	you	for	a	minute.	What	will	you	have?	What	about	a	hot	toddy?	Shall	I make	one?"	he	demanded,	smiling.	"Donovan	taught	me	how,	and	I'm	really rather	good	at	it."

She	smiled	back	at	him,	and	put	her	hand	up	to	smooth	his	hair.	"That	would	be another	exchange,	Peter,"	she	said,	"and	I	don't	want	it.	Only	one	thing	can	warm me	to-night	and	give	me	rest."

He	read	what	she	meant	in	her	eyes,	and	knelt	beside	the	chair	to	put	his	arms around	her.	She	leaned	her	face	on	his	shoulder,	and	returned	the	kisses	that	he showered	upon	her.	"Poor	mayflies,"	she	said	to	herself,	"how	they	love	to	dance in	the	sun!"





CHAPTER	IX

Ever	after	that	next	day,	the	Saturday,	will	remain	in	Peter's	memory	as	a	time	by itself,	of	special	significance,	but	a	significance,	except	for	one	incident,	very hard	to	place.	It	began,	indeed,	very	quietly,	and	very	happily.	They	breakfasted again	in	their	own	room,	and	Julie	was	in	one	of	her	subdued	moods,	if	one	ever could	say	she	was	subdued.	Afterwards	Peter	lit	a	cigarette	and	strolled	over	to the	window.	"It's	a	beastly	day,"	he	said,	"cloudy,	cold,	windy,	and	going	to	rain, I	think.	What	shall	we	do?	Snow	up	in	the	hotel	all	the	time?"

"No,"	said	Julie	emphatically,	"something	quite	different.	You	shall	show	me some	of	the	real	London	sights,	Westminster	Abbey	to	begin	with.	Then	we'll drive	along	the	Embankment	and	you	shall	tell	me	what	everything	is,	and	we'll go	and	see	anything	else	you	suggest.	I	don't	suppose	you	realise,	Peter,	that	I'm all	but	absolutely	ignorant	of	London."

He	turned	and	smiled	on	her.	"And	you	really	 want	to	see	these	things?"	he	said.

"Yes,	of	course	I	do.	You	don't	think	I	suggested	it	for	your	benefit?	But	if	it	will make	you	any	happier,	I'll	flatter	you	a	bit.	I	want	to	see	those	things	now,	with you,	partly	because	I'm	never	likely	to	find	anyone	who	can	show	me	them better.	Now	then.	Aren't	you	pleased?"

At	that,	then,	they	started.	Westminster	came	first,	and	they	wandered	all	over	it and	saw	as	much	as	the	conditions	of	war	had	left	for	the	public	to	see.	It	amused Peter	to	show	Julie	the	things	that	seemed	to	him	to	have	a	particular	interest—

the	Chapter	House,	St.	Faith's	Chapel,	the	tomb	of	the	Confessor,	and	so	on.	She made	odd	comments.	In	St.	Faith's	she	said:	"I	don't	say	many	prayers,	Peter,	but here	I	couldn't	say	one."

"Why	not?"	he	demanded.

"Because	it's	too	private,"	she	said	quaintly.	"I	should	think	I	was	pretending	to be	a	saint	if	I	went	past	everybody	else	and	the	vergers	and	things	into	a	little place	like	this	all	by	myself.	Everyone	would	know	that	I	was	doing	something which	most	people	don't	do.	See?	Why	don't	people	pray	all	over	the	church,	as they	do	in	France	in	a	cathedral,	Peter?"

He	shrugged	his	shoulders.	"Come	on,"	he	said;	"your	notions	are	all	topsy-turvy,	Julie.	Come	and	look	at	the	monuments."

They	wandered	down	the	transept,	and	observed	the	majesty	of	England	in	stone, robed	in	togas,	declaiming	to	the	Almighty,	and	obviously	convinced	that	He would	be	intensely	interested;	or	perhaps	dying	in	the	arms	of	a	semi-dressed female,	with	funeral	urns	or	ships	or	cannon	in	the	background;	or,	at	least	in	one case,	crouching	hopelessly,	before	the	dart	of	a	triumphant	death.	Julie	was certainly	impressed,	"They	are	all	like	ancient	Romans,	Peter,"	she	said,	"and much	more	striking	than	those	Cardinals	and	Bishops	and	Kings,	kneeling	at prayer,	in	Rouen	Cathedral.	But,	still,	they	were	 not	ancient	Romans,	were	they?

They	were	all	Christians,	I	suppose.	Is	there	a	Christian	monument	anywhere about?"

"I	don't	know,"	said	Peter,	"but	we'll	walk	round	and	see."

They	made	a	lengthy	pilgrimage,	and	finally	Peter	arrested	her.	"Here's	one,"	he said.

A	Georgian	Bishop	in	bas-relief	looked	down	on	them,	fat	and	comfortable.	In front	of	him	was	a	monstrous	cup,	and	a	plate	piled	with	biggish	squares	of stone.	Julie	did	not	realise	what	it	was.	"What's	he	doing	with	all	that	lump-sugar?"	she	demanded.

Peter	was	really	a	bit	horrified.	"You're	an	appalling	pagan,"	he	said.

"Come	away!"	And	they	came.

They	roamed	along	the	Embankment.	Julie	was	as	curious	as	a	child,	and	wanted to	know	all	about	everything,	from	Boadicea,	Cleopatra's	Needle,	and	the Temple	Church,	to	Dewar's	Whisky	Works	and	the	Hotel	Cecil.	Thereabouts, Julie	asked	the	name	of	the	squat	tower	and	old	red-brick	buildings	opposite,	and when	she	heard	it	was	Lambeth	Palace	instantly	demanded	to	visit	it.	Peter	was doubtful	if	they	could,	but	they	crossed	to	see,	and	they	were	shown	a	good	deal by	the	courtesy	of	the	authorities.	The	Archbishop	was	away,	to	Peter's	great

relief,	for	as	likely	as	not	Julie	would	have	insisted	on	an	introduction,	but	they saw	the	chapel	and	the	dining-hall	amongst	other	things.	The	long	line	of portraits	fascinated	her,	but	not	as	it	fascinated	Peter.	The	significance	of	the change	in	the	costumes	of	the	portraits	struck	him	for	the	first	time—first	the cope	and	mitre	and	cross,	then	the	skull-cap	and	the	tippet,	then	the	balloon-sleeves	and	the	wig,	then	the	coat	and	breeches	and	white	cravat,	then	the academic	robes,	and	then	a	purple	cassock.	Its	interest	to	Julie	was	other, however.	"Peter,"	she	whispered,	"perhaps	you'll	be	there	one	day."

He	looked	at	her	sharply,	but	she	was	not	mocking	him,	and,	marvelling	at	her simplicity	and	honest	innocence,	he	relaxed	into	a	smile.	"Not	very	likely,	my dear,"	he	said.	"In	other	days	a	pleasant	underground	cell	in	the	Lollards'	Tower would	have	been	more	likely."

Then,	of	course,	Julie	must	see	the	famous	tower,	and	see	a	little	of	it	they	did.

She	wanted	to	know	what	Lollardy	was;	their	guide	attempted	an	explanation.

Julie	was	soon	bored.	"I	can't	see	why	people	make	such	a	bother	about	such things,"	she	said.	"A	man's	religion	is	his	own	business,	surely,	and	he	must settle	it	for	himself.	Don't	you	think	so,	Peter?"

"Is	it	his	own	business	only?"	he	asked	gravely.

"Whose	else	should	it	be?"	she	demanded.

"God's,"	said	Peter	simply.

Julie	stared	at	him	and	sighed.	"You're	very	odd,	Peter,"	she	said,	"but	you	do	say things	that	strike	one	as	being	true.	Go	on."

"Oh,	there's	no	more	to	say,"	said	Peter,	"except,	perhaps,	this:	if	anyone	or	any Church	honestly	believed	that	God	had	committed	His	share	in	the	business	to them—well,	then	he	might	justifiably	feel	that	he	or	it	had	a	good	deal	to	do	with the	settling	of	another	man's	religion.	Hence	this	tower,	Julie,	and	as	a	matter	of fact,	my	dear,	hence	me,	past	and	present.	But	come	on."

She	took	his	arm	with	a	little	shiver	which	he	was	beginning	to	notice	from	time to	time	in	her.	"It's	a	horrible	idea,	Peter,"	she	said.	"Yes,	let's	go."

So	their	taxi	took	them	to	Buckingham	Palace	and	thereabouts,	and	by	chance they	saw	the	King	and	Queen.	Their	Majesties	drove	by	smartly	in	morning

dress	with	a	couple	of	policemen	ahead,	and	a	few	women	waved	handkerchiefs, and	Peter	came	to	the	salute,	and	Julie	cheered.	The	Queen	turned	towards	where she	was	standing,	and	bowed,	and	Peter	noticed,	amazed,	that	the	eyes	of	the Colonial	girl	were	wet,	and	that	she	did	not	attempt	to	hide	it.

He	had	to	question	her.	"I	shouldn't	have	thought	you'd	have	felt	about	royalty like	that,	Julie,"	he	said.

"Well,	I	do,"	she	said,	"and	I	don't	care	what	you	say.	Only	I	wish	they'd	go about	with	the	Life	Guards.	The	King's	a	King	to	me.	I	suppose	he	is	only	a	man, but	I	don't	want	to	think	of	him	so.	He	stands	for	the	Empire	and	for	the	Flag, and	he	stands	for	England	too.	I'd	obey	that	man	almost	in	anything,	right	or wrong,	but	I	don't	know	that	I'd	obey	anyone	else."

"Then	you're	a	survival	of	the	Dark	Ages,"	he	said.

"Don't	be	a	beast!"	said	Julie.

"All	right,	you're	not,	and	indeed	I	don't	know	if	I	am	right.	Very	likely	you're the	very	embodiment	of	the	spirit	of	the	Present	Day.	Having	lost	every authority,	you	crave	for	one."

Julie	considered	this.	"There	may	be	something	in	that,"	she	said.	"But	I	don't like	you	when	you're	clever.	It	was	the	King,	and	that's	enough	for	me.	And	I don't	want	to	see	anything	more.	I'm	hungry;	take	me	to	lunch."

Peter	laughed.	"That's	it,"	he	said—"like	the	follower	of	Prince	Charlie	who shook	hands	once	with	his	Prince	and	then	vowed	he	would	never	shake	hands with	anyone	again.	So	you've	seen	the	King,	and	you	won't	see	anything	else, only	your	impression	won't	last	twelve	hours,	fortunately."

"I	don't	suppose	the	other	man	kept	his	vow,"	said	Julie.	"For	one	thing,	no	man ever	does.	Come	on!"

And	so	they	drifted	down	the	hours	until	the	evening	theatre	and	 Carminetta.

They	said	and	did	nothing	in	particular,	but	they	just	enjoyed	themselves.	In point	of	fact,	they	were	emotionally	tired,	and,	besides,	they	wanted	to	forget how	the	time	sped	by.	The	quiet	day	was,	in	its	own	way	too,	a	preparation	for the	evening	feast,	and	they	were	both	in	the	mood	to	enjoy	the	piece	intensely when	it	came.	The	magnificence	of	the	new	theatre	in	which	it	was	staged	all

helped.	Its	wide,	easy	stairways,	its	many	conveniences,	its	stupendous auditorium,	its	packed	house,	ushered	it	well	in.	Even	the	audience	seemed different	from	that	of	last	night.

Julie	settled	herself	with	a	sigh	of	satisfaction	to	listen	and	watch.	And	they	both grew	silent	as	the	opera	proceeded.	At	first	Julie	could	not	contain	her	delight.

"Oh,	she's	perfect,	Peter,"	she	exclaimed—"a	little	bit	of	life!	Look	how	she shakes	her	hair	back	and	how	impudent	she	is—just	like	one	of	those	French girls	you	know	too	much	about!	And	she's	boiling	passion	too.	And	a	regular devil.	I	love	her,	Peter!"

"She's	very	like	you,	Julie,"	said	Peter.

Julie	flashed	a	look	at	him.	"Rubbish!"	she	said,	but	was	silent.

They	watched	while	Carminetta	set	herself	to	win	her	bet	and	steal	the	heart	of the	hero	from	the	Governor's	daughter.	They	watched	her	force	the	palace ballroom,	and	forgot	the	obvious	foolishness	of	a	great	deal	of	it	in	the	sense	of the	drama	that	was	being	worked	out.	The	whole	house	grew	still.	The	English girl,	with	her	beauty,	her	civilisation,	her	rank	and	place,	made	her	appeal	to	her fiancé;	and	the	Spanish	bastard	dancer,	with	her	daring,	her	passion,	her	naked humanity,	so	coarse	and	so	intensely	human,	made	her	appeal	also.	And	they watched	while	the	young	conventionally-bred	officer	hesitated;	they	watched	till Carminetta	won.

Julie,	leaning	forward,	held	her	breath	and	gazed	at	the	beautiful	fashionable room	on	the	stage,	gazed	through	the	open	French	windows	to	the	moonlit garden	and	the	night	beyond,	and	gazed,	though	at	last	she	could	hardly	see,	at the	Spanish	girl.	That	great	renunciation	held	them	both	entranced.	So	bitter-sweet,	so	humanly	divine,	the	passionate,	heart-broken,	heroic	song	of	farewell, swelled	and	thrilled	about	them.	And	with	the	last	notes	the	child	of	the	gutter reached	up	and	up	till	she	made	the	supreme	self-sacrifice,	and	stepped	out	of the	gay	room	into	the	dark	night	for	the	sake	of	the	man	she	loved	too	much	to love.

Then	Julie	bowed	her	head	into	her	hands,	and	in	the	silence	and	darkness	of their	box	burst	into	tears.	And	so,	for	the	first	and	last	time,	Peter	heard	her really	weep.

He	said	foolish	man-things	to	comfort	her.	She	looked	up	at	last,	smiling,	her

brown	eyes	challengingly	brave	through	her	tears,	"Peter,	forgive	me,"	she	said.

"I	shouldn't	be	such	a	damned	fool!	You	never	thought	I	could	be	like	that,	did you?	But	it	was	so	superbly	done,	I	couldn't	help	it.	It's	all	over	now—all	over, Peter,"	she	added	soberly.	"I	want	to	sit	in	the	lounge	to-night	for	a	little,	if	you don't	mind.	Could	you	possibly	get	a	taxi?	I	don't	want	to	walk."

It	was	difficult	to	find	one.	Finally	Peter	and	another	officer	made	a	bolt simultaneously	and	each	got	hold	of	a	door	of	a	car	that	was	just	coming	up.

Both	claimed	it,	and	the	chauffeur	looked	round	good-humouredly	at	the disputants.	"Settle	it	which-hever	way	you	like,	gents,"	he	said.	"Hi	don't	care, but	settle	it	soon."

"Let's	toss,"	said	Peter.

"Right-o,"	said	the	other	man,	and	produced	a	coin.

"Tails,"	whispered	Julie	behind	Peter,	and	"Tails!"	he	called.

The	coin	spun	while	the	little	crowd	looked	on	in	amusement,	and	tails	it	was.

"Damn!"	said	the	other,	and	turned	away.

"A	bad	loser,	Peter,"	said	Julie;	"and	he's	just	been	seeing	 Carminetta,	too!	But am	I	not	lucky!	I	almost	always	win."

In	the	palm	lounge	Julie	was	very	cheerful.	"Coffee,	Peter,"	she	said,	"and liqueurs."

"No	drinks	after	nine-thirty,"	said	the	waiter.	"Sorry,	sir."

Julie	laughed.	"I	nearly	swore,	Peter,"	she	said,	"but	I	remembered	in	time.	If	one can't	get	what	one	wants,	one	has	to	go	without	singing.	But	I'll	have	a	cigarette, not	to	say	two,	before	we've	finished.	And	I'm	in	no	hurry;	I	want	to	sit	on	here and	pretend	it's	not	Saturday	night.	And	I	want	to	go	very	slowly	to	bed,	and	I don't	want	to	sleep."

"Is	that	the	effect	of	the	theatre?"	asked	Peter.	"And	why	so	different	from	last night?"

Julie	evaded.	"Don't	you	feel	really	different?"	she	demanded.

"Yes,"	he	said.

"How?"

"Well,	I	don't	want	to	preach	any	sermon	to-night.	It's	been	preached."

Julie	drew	hard	on	her	cigarette,	and	blew	out	a	cloud	of	smoke.	"It	has,	Peter,"

she	said	merrily,	"and	thank	the	Lord	I	am	therefore	spared	another."

"You're	very	gay	about	it	now,	Julie,	but	you	weren't	at	first.	That	play	made	me feel	rather	miserable	too.	No,	I	think	it	made	me	feel	small.	Carminetta	was great,	wasn't	she?	I	don't	know	that	there	is	anything	greater	than	that	sort	of sacrifice.	And	it's	far	beyond	me,"	said	Peter.

Julie	leaned	back	and	hummed	a	bar	or	two	that	Peter	recognised	from	the	last great	song	of	the	dancer.	"Well,	my	dear,	I	was	sad,	wasn't	I?"	she	said.	"But	it's over.	There's	no	use	in	sadness,	is	there?"

Peter	did	not	reply,	and	started	as	Julie	suddenly	laughed.	"Oh,	good	Lord, Peter!"	she	exclaimed,	"to	what	 are	you	bringing	me?	Do	you	know	that	I'm about	to	quote	Scripture?	And	I	damn-well	shall	if	we	sit	on	here!	Let's	walk	up Regent	Street;	I	can't	sit	still.	Come	on."	She	jumped	up.

"Just	now,"	he	said,	"you	wanted	to	sit	still	for	ages,	and	now	you	want	to	walk.

What	is	the	matter	with	you,	Julie?	And	what	was	the	text?"

"That	would	be	telling!"	she	laughed.	"But	can't	I	do	anything	I	like,	Peter?"	she demanded.	"Can't	I	go	and	get	drunk	if	I	like,	Peter,	or	sit	still,	or	dance	down Regent	Street,	or	send	you	off	to	bed	and	pick	up	a	nice	boy?	It	would	be	easy enough	here.	Can't	I,	Peter?"

Her	mood	bewildered	him,	and,	without	in	the	least	understanding	why,	he resented	her	levity.	But	he	tried	to	hide	it.	"Of	course	you	can,"	he	said	lightly;

"but	you	don't	really	want	to	do	those	things,	do	you—especially	the	last,	Julie?"

She	stood	there	looking	at	him,	and	then,	in	a	moment,	the	excitement	died	out of	her	voice	and	eyes.	She	dropped	into	a	chair	again.	"No,	Peter,"	she	said,	"I don't.	That's	the	marvel	of	it.	I	expect	I	shall,	one	of	these	days,	do	most	of	those things,	and	the	last	as	well,	but	I	don't	think	I'll	ever	 want	to	do	them	again.	And that's	what	you've	done	to	me,	my	dear."

Peter	was	very	moved.	He	slipped	his	hand	out	and	took	hers	under	cover	of	her dress.	"My	darling,"	he	whispered,	"I	owe	you	everything.	You	have	given	me all,	and	I	won't	hold	back	all	from	you.	Do	you	remember,	Julie,	that	once	I	said I	thought	I	loved	you	more	than	God?	Well,	I	know	now—oh	yes,	I	believe	I	do know	now.	But	I	choose	you,	Julie."

Her	eyes	shone	up	at	him	very	brightly,	and	he	could	not	read	them	altogether.

But	her	lips	whispered,	and	he	thought	he	understood.

"Oh,	Peter,	my	dearest,"	she	said,	"thank	God	I	have	at	least	heard	you	say	that.	I wouldn't	have	missed	you	saying	those	words	for	anything,	Peter."

So	might	the	serving-girl	in	Pilate's	courtyard	have	been	glad,	had	she	been	in love.





CHAPTER	X

Part	at	least	of	Julie's	programme	was	fulfilled	to	the	letter,	for	they	lay	long in	bed	talking—desultory,	reminiscent	talk,	which	sent	Peter's	mind	back over	the	months	and	the	last	few	days,	even	after	Julie	was	asleep	in	the	bed next	his.	Like	a	pageant,	he	passed,	in	review	scene	after	scene,	turning	it over,	and	wondering	at	significances	that	he	had	not	before,	imagined.	He recalled	their	first	meeting,	that	instantaneous	attraction,	and	he	asked himself	what	had	caused	it.	Her	spontaneity,	freshness,	and	utter	lack	of conventionality,	he	supposed,	but	that	did	not	seem	to	explain	all.	He wondered	at	the	change	that	had	even	then	come	about	in	himself	that	he should	have	been	so	entranced	by	her,	He	went	over	his	early	hopes	and fears;	he	thought	again	of	conversations	with	Langton;	and	he	realised afresh	how	true	it	was	that	the	old	authorities	had	dwindled	away;	that	no allegiance	had	been	left;	that	his	had	been	a	citadel	without	a	master.	And then	Julie	moved	through	his	days	again—Julie	at	Caudebec,	daring, iconoclastic,	free;	Julie	at	Abbeville,	mysterious,	passionate,	dominant;	Julie at	Dieppe—ah,	Julie	at	Dieppe!	He	marvelled	that	he	had	held	out	so	long after	Dieppe,	and	then	Louise	rose	before	him.	He	understood	Louise	less than	Julie,	perhaps,	and	with	all	the	threads	in	his	hand	he	failed	to	see	the pattern.	He	turned	over	restlessly.	It	was	easy	to	see	how	they	had	come	to be	in	London;	it	would	have	been	more	remarkable	if	they	had	not	so	come together;	but	now,	what	now?	He	could	not	sum	up	Julie	amid	the	shifting scenes	of	the	last	few	days.	She	had	been	so	loving,	and	yet,	in	a	way,	their love	had	reached	no	climax.	It	had,	indeed,	reached	what	he	would	once have	thought	a	complete	and	ultimate	climax,	but	plainly	Julie	did	not	think so.	And	nor	did	he—now.	The	things	of	the	spirit	were,	after	all,	so	much greater	than	the	things	of	the	flesh.	The	Julie	of	Friday	night	had	been	his, but	of	this	night…?	He	rolled	over	again.	What	had	she	meant	at	the	play?

He	told	himself	her	tears	were	simple	emotion,	her	laughter	simple	reaction, but	he	knew	it	was	not	true….

And	for	himself?	Well,	Julie	was	Julie.	He	loved	her	intensely.	She	could	stir him	to	anything	almost.	He	loved	to	be	with	her,	to	see	her,	to	hear	her,	but	he did	not	feel	satisfied.	He	knew	that.	He	told	himself	that	he	was	an	introspective fool;	that	nothing	ever	would	seem	to	satisfy	him;	that	the	centre	of	his	life	 was and	would	be	Julie;	that	she	was	real,	tinglingly,	intensely	real;	but	he	knew	that that	was	not	the	last	word.	And	then	and	there	he	resolved	that	the	last	word should	be	spoken	on	the	morrow,	that	had,	indeed,	already	come	by	the	clock: she	should	promise	to	marry	him.

He	slept,	perhaps,	for	an	hour	or	two,	but	he	awoke	with	the	dawn.	The	grey light	was	stealing	in	at	the	windows,	and	Julie	slept	beside	him	in	the	bed between.	He	tried	to	sleep	again,	but	could	not,	and,	on	a	sudden,	had	an	idea.

He	got	quietly	out	of	bed.

"What	is	it,	Peter?"	said	Julie	sleepily.

He	went	round	and	leaned	over	her.	"I	can't	sleep	any	more,	dearest,"	he	said.	"I think	I'll	dress	and	go	for	a	bit	of	a	walk.	Do	you	mind?	I'll	be	in	to	breakfast."

"No,"	she	said.	"Go	if	you	want	to.	You	are	a	restless	old	thing!"

He	dressed	silently,	and	kept	the	bathroom	door	closed	as	he	bathed	and	shaved.

She	was	asleep	again	as	he	stole	out,	one	arm	flung	loosely	on	the	counterpane, her	hair	untidy	on	the	pillow.	He	kissed	a	lock	of	it,	and	let	himself	quietly	out	of their	suite.

It	was	still	very	early,	and	the	Circus	looked	empty	and	strange.	He	walked	down Piccadilly,	and	wondered	at	the	clean,	soft	touch	of	the	dawning	day,	and recalled	another	memorable	Sunday	morning	walk.	He	passed	very	familiar places,	and	was	conscious	of	feeling	an	exile,	an	inevitable	one,	but	none	the	less an	exile,	for	all	that.	And	so	he	came	into	St.	James's	Park,	still	as	aimlessly	as he	had	left	the	hotel.

Before	him,	clear	as	a	pointing	finger	in	the	morning	sky,	was	the	campanile	of that	stranger	among	the	great	cathedrals	of	England.	It	attracted	him	for	the	first time,	and	he	made	all	but	unconsciously	towards	it,	Peter	was	not	even	in	the spiritual	street	that	leads	to	the	gates	of	the	Catholic	Church,	and	it	was	no incipient	Romanism	that	moved	him.	He	was	completely	ignorant	of	the	greater part	of	that	faith,	and,	still	more,	had	no	idea	of	the	gulf	that	separates	it	from	all other	religions.	He	would	have	supposed,	if	he	had	stopped	to	think,	that,	as	with

other	sects,	one	considered	its	tenets,	made	up	one's	mind	as	to	their	truth	or falsehood	one	by	one,	and	if	one	believed	a	sufficient	majority	of	them	joined the	Church.	It	was	only,	then,	the	mood	of	the	moment,	and	when,	he	found himself	really	moving	towards	that	finger-post	he	excused	himself	by	thinking that	as	he	was,	by	his	own	act,	exiled,	from,	more	familiar	temples,	he	would visit	this	that	would	have	about	it	a	suggestion	of	France.

He	wondered	if	it	would	be	open	as	he	turned	into	Ashley	Gardens.	He	glanced at	his	watch;	it	was	only	just	after	seven.	Perhaps	an	early	Mass	might	be beginning.	He	went	to	the	central	doors	and	found	them	fast;	then	he	saw	little groups	of	people	and	individuals	like	himself	making	for	the	door	in	the	great tower,	and	these	he	followed	within.

He	stood	amazed	for	a	few	minutes.	The	vast	soaring	space,	so	austere	in	its	bare brick,	gripped	his	imagination.	The	white	and	red	and	gold	of	the	painted	Christ that	hung	so	high	and	monstrous	before	the	entrance	to	the	marbles	of	the sanctuary	almost	troubled	him.	It	dominated	everything	so	completely	that	he felt	he	could	not	escape	it.	He	sought	one	of	the	many	chairs	and	knelt	down.

A	little	bell	tinkled,	Peter	glanced	sideways	towards	the	sound,	and	saw	that	a Mass	was	in	progress	in	a	side-chapel	of	gleaming	mosaics,	and	that	a	soldier	in uniform	served.	Hardly	had	he	taken	the	details	in,	when	another	bell	claimed his	attention.	It	came	from	across	the	wide	nave,	and	he	perceived	that	another chapel	had	its	Mass,	and	a	considerable	congregation.	And	then,	his	attention aroused,	he	began	to	spy	about	and	to	take	in	the	thing.

The	whole	vast	cathedral	was,	as	it	were,	alive.	Seven	or	eight	Masses	were	in progress.	One	would	scarcely	finish	before	another	priest,	preceded	by	soldier	in uniform	or	server	in	cassock	and	cotta,	would	appear	from	beyond	the	great pulpit	and	make	his	way	to	yet	another	altar.	The	small	handbells	rang	out	again and	again	and	again,	and	still	priest	after	priest	was	there	to	take	his	place.	Peter began	cautiously	to	move	about.	He	became	amazed	at	the	size	of	the congregation.	They	had	been	lost	in	that	great	place,	but	every	chapel	had	its people,	and	there	were,	in	reality,	hundreds	scattered	about	in	the	nave	alone.

He	knelt	for	awhile	and	watched	the	giving	of	Communion	in	the	guarded	chapel to	the	north	of	the	high	altar.	Its	gold	and	emblazoned	gates	were	not	for	him,	but he	could	at	least	kneel	and	watch	those	who	passed	in	and	out.	They	were	of	all sorts	and	classes,	of	all	ranks	and	ages;	men,	women,	children,	old	and	young,

rich	and	poor,	soldier	and	civilian,	streamed	in	and	out	again.	Peter	sighed	and left	them.	He	found	an	altar	at	which	Mass	was	about	to	begin,	and	he	knelt	at the	back	on	a	mosaic	pavement	in	which	fishes	and	strange	beasts	were	set	in	a marble	stream,	and	watched.	And	it	was	not	one	Mass	that	he	watched,	but	two or	three,	and	it	was	there	that	a	vision	grew	on	his	inner	understanding,	as	he knelt	and	could	not	pray.

It	is	hard	and	deceptive	to	write	of	those	subconscious	imaginings	that	convict the	souls	of	most	men	some	time	or	another.	In	that	condition	things	are	largely what	we	fashion	them	to	be,	and	one	may	be	thought	to	be	asserting	their ultimate	truth	in	speaking	of	their	influence.	But	there	is	no	escaping	from	the fact	that	Peter	Graham	of	a	lost	allegiance	began	that	Sunday	morning	to	be aware	of	another	claimant.	And	this	is	what	dawned	upon	him,	and	how.

A	French	memory	gave	him	a	starting-point.	Here,	at	these	Low	Masses,	it	was more	abundantly	plain	than	ever	that	these	priests	did	not	conceive	themselves	to be	serving	a	congregation,	but	an	altar.	One	after	the	other	they	moved	through	a ritual,	and	spoke	low	sentences	that	hardly	reached	him,	with	their	eyes	holden by	that	which	they	did.	At	first	he	was	only	conscious	of	this,	but	then	he perceived	the	essential	change	that	came	over	each	in	his	turn.	The	posturing	and speaking	was	but	introductory	to	the	moment	when	they	raised	the	Host	and knelt	before	it.	It	was	as	if	they	were	but	functionaries	ushering	in	a	King,	and then	effacing	themselves	before	Him.

Here,	then,	the	Old	Testament	of	Peter's	past	became	to	him	a	schoolmaster.	He heard	himself	repeating	again	the	comfortable	words	of	the	Prayer-Book	service:

"Come	unto	Me…."	"God	so	loved…."	"If	any	man	sin…."	Louise's	hot declaration	forced	itself	upon	him:	"It	is	He	Who	is	there."	And	it	was	then	that the	eyes	of	his	mind	were	enlightened	and	he	saw	a	vision—not,	indeed,	of	the truth	of	the	Roman	Mass	(if	it	be	true),	and	not	of	the	place	of	the	Sacrament	in the	Divine	scheme	of	things,	but	the	conception	of	a	love	so	great	that	it	shook him	as	if	it	were	a	storm,	and	bowed	him	before	it	as	if	he	were	a	reed.

The	silent,	waiting	Jesus….	All	these	centuries,	in	every	land….	How	He	had been	mocked,	forgotten,	spurned,	derided,	denied,	cast	out;	and	still	He	waited.

Prostitutes	of	the	streets,	pardoned	in	a	word,	advanced	towards	Him,	and	He knew	that	so	shortly	again,	within	the	secret	place	of	their	hearts,	He	would	be crucified;	but	still	He	waited.	Careless	men,	doubtless	passion-mastered,	came up	to	Him,	and	He	knew	the	sort	that	came;	but	still	He	waited.	He,	Peter,	who

had	not	known	He	was	here	at	all,	and	who	had	gone	wandering	off	in	search	of any	mistress,	spent	many	days,	turned	in	by	chance,	and	found	Him	here.	What did	He	wait	for?	Nothing;	there	was	nothing	that	anyone	could	give,	nothing	but a	load	of	shame,	the	offering	of	a	body	spent	by	passionate	days,	the	kiss	of traitor-lips;	but	still	He	waited.	He	did	more	than	wait.	He	offered	Himself	to	it all.	He	had	bound	Himself	by	an	oath	to	be	kissed	if	Judas	planned	to	kiss	Him, and	He	came	through	the	trees	to	that	bridal	with	the	dawn	of	every	day.	He	had foreseen	the	chalice,	foreseen	that	it	would	be	filled	at	every	moon	and	every	sun by	the	bitter	gall	of	ingratitude	and	wantonness	and	hate,	but	He	had	pledged Himself—"Even	so,	Father"—and	He	was	here	to	drink	it.	Small	wonder,	then, that	the	paving	on	which	Peter	Graham	knelt	seemed	to	swim	before	his	eyes until	it	was	in	truth	a	moving	ocean	of	love	that	streamed	from	the	altar	and enclosed	of	every	kind,	and	even	him.

The	movement	of	chairs	and	the	gathering	of	a	bigger	congregation	than	usual near	a	chapel	that	Peter	perceived	to	be	for	the	dead	aroused	him.	He	got	up	to go.	He	walked	quickly	up	Victoria	Street,	and	marvelled	over	the	scene	he	had left.	In	sight	of	Big	Ben	he	glanced	up—twenty	to	nine!	He	had	been,	then,	an hour	and	a	half	in	the	cathedral.	He	recalled	having	read	that	a	Mass	took	half	an hour,	and	he	began	to	reckon	how	many	persons	had	heard	Mass	even	while	he had	been	there.	Not	less	than	five	hundred	at	every	half-hour,	and	most	probably more.	Fifteen	hundred	to	two	thousand	souls,	of	every	sort	and	kind,	then,	had been	drawn	in	to	that	all	but	silent	ceremony,	to	that	showing	of	Jesus	crucified.

A	multitude—and	what	compassion!

Thus	he	walked	home,	thinking	of	many	things,	but	the	vision	he	had	seen	was uppermost	and	would	not	be	displaced.	It	was	still	in	his	eyes	as	he	entered	their bedroom	and	found	Julie	looking	at	a	magazine	as	she	lay	in	bed,	smoking	a cigarette.

"Lor',	Peter,	are	you	back?	I	suppose	I	ought	to	be	up,	but	I	was	so	sleepy.

What's	the	time?	Why,	what's	the	matter?	Where	have	you	been?"

Peter	did	not	go	over	to	her	at	once	as	she	had	expected.	It	was	not	that	he	felt	he could	not,	or	anything	like	that,	but	simply	that	he	was	only	thinking	of	her	in	a secondary	way.	He	walked	to	the	dressing-table	and	lifted	the	flowers	she	had worn	the	night	before	and	put	there	in	a	little	glass.

"Where	have	you	been,	old	Solomon?"	demanded	Julie	again.

"Seeing	wonders,	Julie,"	said	Peter,	looking	dreamily	at	the	blossoms.

"No?	Really?	What?	Do	tell	me.	If	it	was	anything	I	might	have	seen,	you	were	a beast	not	to	come	back	for	me,	d'you	hear?"

Peter	turned	and	stared	at	her,	but	she	knew	as	he	looked	that	he	hardly	saw	her.

Her	tone	changed,	and	she	made	a	little	movement	with	her	hand,	"Tell	me, Peter,"	she	said	again.

"I've	seen,"	said	Peter	slowly,	"a	bigger	thing	than	I	thought	the	world	could hold,	I've	seen	something	so	wonderful,	Julie,	that	it	hurt—oh,	more	than	I	can say.	I've	seen	Love,	Julie."

She	could	not	help	it.	It	was	a	foolish	thing	to	say	just	then,	she	knew,	but	it came	out.	"Oh,	Peter,"	she	said,	"did	you	have	to	leave	me	to	see	that?"

"Leave	you?"	he	questioned,	and	for	a	moment	so	lost	in	his	thought	was	he	that he	did	not	understand	what	she	meant.	Then	it	dawned	on	him,	and	he	smiled.

He	did	not	see	as	he	stood	there,	the	clumsy	Peter,	how	the	two	were	related.	So he	smiled,	and	he	came	over	to	her,	and	took	her	hand,	and	sat	on	the	bed,	his eyes	still	full	of	light.	"Oh,	you've	nothing	to	do	with	it,"	he	said.	"It's	far	bigger than	you	or	I,	Julie.	Our	love	is	like	a	candle	held	up	to	the	sun	beside	it.	Our love	wants	something,	doesn't	it?	It	burns,	it—it	intoxicates,	Julie.	But	this	love waits, waits,	do	you	understand?	It	asks	nothing;	it	gives,	it	suffices	all.	Year after	year	it	just	waits,	Julie,	waits	for	anyone,	waits	for	everyone.	And	you	can spurn	it,	spit	on	it,	crucify	it,	and	it	is	still	there	when	you—need,	Julie."	And Peter	leaned	forward,	and	buried	his	face	in	her	little	hand.

Julie	heard	him	through,	and	it	was	well	that	before	the	end	he	did	not	see	her eyes.	Then	she	moved	her	other	hand	which	held	the	half-burnt	cigarette	and dropped	the	smoking	end	(so	that	it	made	a	little	hiss)	into	her	teacup	on	the glass-topped	table,	and	brought	her	hand	back,	and	caressed	his	hair	as	he	lay bent	forward	there.	"Dear	old	Peter,"	she	said	tenderly,	"how	he	thinks	things!

And	when	you	saw	this—this	love,	Peter,	how	did	you	feel?"

He	did	not	answer	for	a	minute,	and	when	he	did	he	did	not	raise	his	head.	"Oh,	I don't	know,	Julie,"	he	said.	"It	went	through	and	through	me.	It	was	like	a	big sea,	and	it	flooded	me	away.	It	filled	me.	I	seemed	to	drink	it	in	at	every	pore.	I felt	satisfied	just	to	be	there."

"And	then	you	came	back	to	Julie,	eh,	Peter?"	she	questioned.

"Why,	of	course,"	he	said,	sitting	up	with	a	smile.	"Why	not?"	He	gave	a	little laugh.	"Why,	Julie,"	he	said,	"I	never	thought	of	that	before.	I	suppose	I	ought	to have	been—oh,	I	don't	know,	but	our	days	together	didn't	seem	to	make	any difference.	That	Love	was	too	big.	It	seemed	to	me	to	be	too	big	to	be—well, jealous,	I	suppose."

She	nodded.	"That	would	be	just	it,	Peter.	That's	how	it	would	seem	to	you.	You see,	I	know.	It's	strange,	my	dear,	but	I	don't	feel	either—jealous."

He	frowned.	"What	do	you	mean?"	he	said.	"Don't	you	understand?	It	was God's	Love	that	I	saw."

She	hesitated	a	second,	and	then	her	face	relaxed	into	a	smile.	"You're	as	blind	as a	bat,	my	dear,	but	I	suppose	all	men	are,	and	so	you	can't	help	it.	Now	go	and ring	for	breakfast	and	smoke	a	cigarette	in	the	sitting-room	while	I	dress."	And Peter,	because	he	hated	to	be	called	a	bat	and	did	not	feel	in	the	least	like	one, went.

He	rang	the	bell,	and	the	maid	answered	it.	She	did	not	wait	for	him	to	give	his order,	but	advanced	towards	him,	her	eyes	sparkling.	"Oh,	sir,"	she	said,	"is madame	up?	I	don't	know	how	to	thank	her,	and	you	too.	I've	wanted	a	frame	for Jack's	picture,	but	I	couldn't	get	a	real	good	one,	I	couldn't.	When	I	sees	this parcel	I	couldn't	think	 what	it	was.	I	forgot	even	as	how	I'd	give	the	lady	my name.	Oh,	she's	the	real	good	one,	she	is.	You'll	forgive	me,	sir,	but	I	know	a	real lady	when	I	see	one.	They	haven't	got	no	airs,	and	they	know	what	a	girl	feels like,	right	away.	I	put	Jack	in	it,	sir,	on	me	table,	and	if	there's	anything	I	can	do for	you	or	your	lady,	now	or	ever,	I'll	do	it,	sir."

Peter	smiled	at	the	little	outburst,	but	his	heart	warmed	within	him.	How	just	like Julie	it	was!	"Well,"	he	said,	"it's	the	lady	you've	really	to	thank.	Knock,	if	you like;	I	expect	she'll	let	you	in.	And	then	order	breakfast,	will	you?	Bacon	and eggs	and	some	fish.	Thanks."	And	he	turned	away.

She	made	for	the	door,	but	stopped,	"I	near	forgot,	sir,"	she	said.	"A	gentleman left	this	for	you	last	night,	and	they	give	it	to	me	at	the	office—this	morning.

There	was	no	answer,	he	said.	He	went	by	this	morning's	train."	She	handed Peter	an	unstamped	envelope	bearing	the	hotel's	name,	and	left	the	room	as	he opened	it.	He	did	not	recognise	the	handwriting,	but	he	tore	it	open	and	glanced

at	once	at	the	signature,	and	got	a	very	considerable	surprise,	not	to	say	a	shock.

It	was	signed	"Jack	Donovan."

"MY	DEAR	GRAHAM,	[the	letter	ran],

"Forgive	me	for	writing,	but	I	must	tell	you	that	I've	seen	you	twice	with	Julie (and	each	time	neither	of	you	saw	anyone	else	but	yourselves!).	It	seems	mean	to see	you	and	not	say	so,	but	for	the	Lord's	sake	don't	think	it'll	go	further,	or	that	I reproach	you.	I've	been	there	myself,	old	bird,	and	in	any	case	I	don't	worry about	other	people's	shows.	But	I	want	to	tell	you	a	bit	of	news—Tommy Raynard	and	I	have	fixed	it	up.	I	know	you'll	congratulate	me.	She's	topping,	and just	the	girl	for	me—no	end	wiser	than	I,	and	as	jolly	as	anyone,	really.	I	don't know	how	you	and	Julie	are	coming	out	of	it,	and	I	won't	guess,	for	it's	a dreadful	war;	but	maybe	you'll	be	able	to	sympathise	with	me	at	having	to	leave my	girl	in	France!	However,	I'm	off	back	to-morrow,	a	day	before	you.	If	you hadn't	run	off	to	Paris,	you'd	have	known.	My	leave	order	was	from	Havre.

"Well,	cheerio.	See	you	before	long.	And	just	one	word,	my	boy,	from	a	fellow who	has	seen	a	bit	more	than	you	(if	you'll	forgive	me):	remember, Julie'll	know best.

"Yours,	ever,

"JACK	DONOVAN."

Peter	frowned	over	his	letter,	and	then	smiled,	and	then	frowned	again.	He	was still	at	it	when	he	heard	Julie's	footstep	outside,	and	he	thrust	the	envelope quickly	into	his	pocket,	thinking	rapidly.	He	did	not	in	the	least	understand	what the	other	meant,	especially	by	the	last	sentence,	and	he	wanted	to	consider	it before	showing	Julie.	Also,	he	wondered	if	it	was	meant	to	be	shown	to	Julie	at all.	He	thought	not;	probably	Donovan	was	absolutely	as	good	as	his	word,	and would	not	even	mention	anything	to	Tommy.	But	he	thought	no	more,	for	Julie was	on	him.

"Peter,	it's	started	to	rain!	I	knew	it	would.	Why	does	it	always	rain	on	Sundays in	London?	Probably	the	heavens	themselves	weep	at	the	sight	of	so	gloomy	a city.	However,	I	don't	care	a	damn!	I've	made	up	my	mind	what	we're	going	to do.	We	shall	sit	in	front	of	the	fire	all	the	morning,	and	you	shall	read	to	me.	Will you?"

"Anything	you	like,	my	darling,"	he	said;	"and	we	couldn't	spend	a	better

morning.	But	bacon	and	eggs	first,	eh?	No,	fish	first,	I	mean.	But	pour	out	a	cup of	tea	at	once,	for	Heaven's	sake. I	haven't	had	a	drop	this	morning."

"Poor	old	thing!	No	wonder	you're	a	bit	off	colour.	No	early	tea	after	that champagne	last	night!	But,	oh,	Peter,	wasn't	 Carminetta	a	dream?"

Breakfast	over,	Peter	sat	in	a	chair	and	bent	over	her.	"What	do	you	want	me	to read,	Julie	darling?"	he	demanded.

She	considered.	" Not	a	magazine, not	La	Vie	Parisienne,	though	we	might perhaps	look	at	the	pictures	part	of	the	time.	I	know!	Stop!	I'll	get	it,"	She	ran	out and	returned	with	a	little	leather-covered	book.	"Read	it	right	through,	Peter,"

she	said.	"I've	read	it	heaps	of	times,	but	I	want	to	hear	it	again	to-day.	Do	you mind?"

"Omar	Khayyám!"	exclaimed	Peter.	"Good	idea!	He's	a	blasphemous	old	pagan, but	the	verse	is	glorious	and	it	fits	in	at	times.	Do	you	want	me	to	start	at	once?"

"Give	me	a	cigarette!	no,	put	the	box	there.	Stir	up	the	fire.	Come	and	sit	on	the floor	with	your	back	to	me.	That's	right.	Now	fire	away."

She	leaned	back	and	he	began.	He	read	for	the	rhythm;	she	listened	for	the meaning.	He	read	to	the	end;	she	hardly	heard	more	than	a	stanza:

"Oh,	threats	of	Hell	and	Hopes	of	Paradise!

One	thing	at	least	is	certain— this	Life	flies; One	thing	is	certain,	and	the	rest	is	lies—

The	flower	that	once	has	blown	for	ever	dies."

They	lunched	in	the	hotel,	and	at	the	table	Peter	put	the	first	necessary	questions that	they	both	dreaded.	"I'm	going	to	tell	them	to	make	out	my	bill,	Julie,"	he said.	"I've	to	be	at	Victoria	at	seven-thirty	a.m.	to-morrow,	you	know.	You've	still got	some	leave,	haven't	you,	dear;	what	are	you	going	to	do?	How	long	will	you stay	on	here?"

"Not	after	you've	gone,	Peter,"	she	said.	"Let	them	make	it	out	for	me	till	after breakfast	to-morrow."

"But	what	are	we	going	to	do?"	he	demanded.

"Oh,	don't	ask.	It	spoils	to-day	to	think	of	to-morrow.	Go	to	my	friends,	perhaps

—yes,	I	think	that.	It's	only	for	a	few	days	now."

"Oh,	Julie,	I	wish	I	could	stay."

"So	do	I,	but	you	can't,	so	don't	worry.	What	about	this	afternoon?"

"If	it's	stopped	raining,	let's	go	for	a	walk,	shall	we?"

They	settled	on	that,	and	it	was	Julie	who	took	him	again	to	St.	James's	Park.	As they	walked:	"Where	did	you	go	to	church	this	morning,	Peter?"	she	asked.

He	pointed	to	the	campanile.	"Over	there,"	he	said.

"Then	let's	go	together	to-night,"	she	said.

"Do	you	mean	it,	Julie?"

"Of	course	I	do.	I'm	curious.	Besides,	it's	Sunday,	and	I	want	to	go	to	church."

"But	you'll	miss	dinner,"	objected	Peter.	"It	begins	at	six-thirty."

"Well,	let's	get	some	food	out—Victoria	Station,	for	instance.	Won't	that	do?	We can	have	some	supper	sent	up	afterwards	in	the	hotel."

Peter	agreed,	but	they	did	not	go	to	the	station.	In	a	little	cafe	outside	Julie	saw	a South	African	private	eating	eggs	and	bacon,	and	nothing	would	do	but	that	they must	do	the	same.	So	they	went	in.	They	ate	off	thick	plates,	and	Julie	dropped the	china	pepper-pot	on	her	eggs	and	generally	behaved	as	if	she	were	at	a school-treat.	But	it	was	a	novelty,	and	it	kept	their	thoughts	off	the	fact	that	it was	the	last	night.	And	finally	they	went	to	church.

The	service	did	not	impress	Peter,	and	every	time	he	looked	at	Julie's	face	he wanted	to	laugh;	but	the	atmosphere	of	the	place	did,	though	he	could	not	catch the	impression	of	the	morning.	For	the	sermon,	a	stoutish,	foreign-looking ecclesiastic	mounted	the	pulpit,	and	they	both	prepared	to	be	bored.	However,	he gave	out	his	text,	and	Peter	sat	bolt	upright	at	once.	It	would	have	delighted	the ears	of	his	Wesleyan	corporal	of	the	Forestry;	and	more	than	that	it	was	the	text he	had	quoted	in	the	ears	of	the	dying	Jenks.	He	prepared	keenly	to	listen.	As	for Julie,	she	was	regarding	the	altar	with	a	far-away	look	in	her	eyes,	and	she scarcely	moved	the	whole	time.

Outside,	as	soon	as	they	were	out	of	the	crowd,	Peter	began	at	once.

"Julie,"	he	said,	"whatever	did	you	think	of	that	sermon?"

"What	did	you?"	she	said.	"Tell	me	first."

"I	don't	believe	you	listened	at	all,	but	I	can't	help	talking	of	it.	It	was	amazing.

He	began	by	speaking	about	Adam	and	Eve	and	original	sin	and	the	Garden	of Eden	as	if	he'd	been	there.	There	might	never	have	been	a	Higher	Critic	in existence.	Then	he	said	what	sin	did,	and	that	sin	was	only	truly	sin	if	it	did	do that. That	was	to	hide	the	face	of	God,	to	put	Him	and	a	human	being	absolutely out	of	communication,	so	to	speak.	And	then	he	came	to	Christ,	to	the	Cross.

Did	you	hear	him,	Julie?	Christ	comes	in	between—He	got	in	between	God	and man.	All	the	anger	that	darted	out	of	God	against	sin	hit	Him;	all	the	blows	that man	struck	back	against	God	hit	Him.	Do	you	see	that,	Julie?	That	was wonderfully	put,	but	the	end	was	more	wonderful.	Both,	ultimately,	cannot	kill the	Heart	of	Jesus.	There's	no	sin	there	to	merit	or	to	feel	the	anger,	and	we	can hurt,	but	we	can't	destroy	His	love."

Peter	stopped,	"That's	what	I	saw	a	little	this	morning,"	he	said	after	a	minute.

"Well?"	said	Julie.

"Oh,	it's	all	so	plain!	If	there	was	a	way	to	that	Heart,	one	would	be	safe.	I	mean, a	way	that	is	not	an	emotional	idea,	not	a	subjective	experience,	but	something practical.	Some	way	that	a	Tommy	could	travel,	as	easily	as	anyone,	and	get	to	a real	thing.	And	he	said	there	was	a	way,	and	just	sketched	it,	the	Sacraments—

more	than	ours,	of	course,	their	seven,	all	of	them	more	or	less,	I	suppose.	He meant	that	the	Sacraments	were	not	signs	of	salvation,	but	salvation	itself.	Julie, I	never	saw	the	idea	before.	It's	colossal.	It's	a	thing	to	which	one	might	dedicate one's	life.	It's	a	thing	to	live	and	die	gladly	for.	It	fills	one.	Don't	you	think	so, Julie?"	He	spoke	exultantly.

"Peter,	to	be	honest,"	said	Julie,	"I	think	you're	talking	fanatical	rubbish."

"Do	you	really,	Julie?	You	can't, surely	you	can't."

"But	I	do,	Peter,"	she	said	sadly;	"it	makes	no	appeal	to	me.	I	can	only	see	one great	thing	in	life,	and	it's	not	that.	'The	rest	is	lies,'	But,	oh!	surely	that	great thing	might	not	be	false	too.	But	why	do	you	see	one	thing,	and	I	another,	my dear?"

"I	don't	know,"	said	Peter,	"unless—well,	perhaps	it's	a	kind	of	gift,	Julie,	'If	thou knewest	the	gift	of	God…'	Not	that	I	know,	only	I	can	just	see	a	great	wonderful vision,	and	it	fills	my	sight."

"I,	too,"	she	said;	"but	it's	not	your	vision."

"What	is	it,	then?"	said	he,	carried	away	by	his	own	ideas	and	hardly	thinking	of her.

Her	voice	brought	him	back.	"Oh,	Peter,	don't	you	know	even	yet?"

He	took	her	arm	very	tenderly	at	that.	"My	darling,"	he	said,	"the	two	aren't incompatible.	Julie,	don't	be	sad.	I	love	you;	you	know	I	love	you.	I	wish	we'd never	gone	to	the	place	if	you	think	I	don't,	but	I	haven't	changed	towards	you	a bit,	Julie.	I	love	you	far,	far	more	than	anyone	else.	I	won't	give	you	up,	even	to God!"

It	was	dark	where	they	were.	Julie	lifted	her	face	to	him	just	there.	He	thought	he had	never	heard	her	speak	as	she	spoke	now,	there,	in	a	London	street,	under	the

night	sky.	"Peter,	my	darling,"	she	said,	"my	brave	boy.	How	I	love	you,	Peter!	I know	 you	won't	give	me	up,	Peter,	and	I	adore	you	for	it.	Peter,	hell	will	be heaven	with	the	memory	of	that!"	There,	then,	he	sealed	her	with	his	kiss.

*	*	*	*	*

Julie	stirred	in	his	arms,	but	the	movement	did	not	wake	him	any	more	than	the knock	of	the	door	had	done.	"All	right,"	she	called.	"Thank	you,"	and,	leaning over,	she	switched	on	the	light.	It	was	5.30,	and	necessary.	In	its	radiance	she bent	over	him,	and	none	of	her	friends	had	ever	seen	her	look	as	she	did	then.

She	kissed	him,	and	he	opened	his	eyes.

"Half-past	five,	Peter,"	she	said,	as	gaily	as	she	could.	"You've	got	to	get	a	move on,	my	dear.	Two	hours	to	dress	and	pack	and	breakfast—no,	I	suppose	you	can do	that	on	the	train.	But	you've	got	to	get	there.	Oh,	Lord,	how	it	brings	the	war home,	doesn't	it?	Jump	up!"

Peter	sighed.	"Blast	the	war!"	he	said	lazily.	"I	shan't	move.	Kiss	me	again,	you darling,	and	let	your	hair	fall	over	my	face."

She	did	so,	and	its	glossy	curtain	hid	them.	Beneath	the	veil	she	whispered;

"Come,	darling,	for	my	sake.	The	longer	you	stay	here	now,	the	harder	it	will be."

He	threw	his	arms	round	her,	and	then	jumped	out	of	bed	yawning.

"That's	it,"	she	said.	"Now	go	and	shave	and	bath	while	I	pack	for	you.

Hurry	up;	then	we'll	get	more	time."

While	he	splashed	about	she	sought	for	his	things,	and	packed	for	him	as	she never	packed	for	herself.	As	she	gathered	them	she	thought	of	the	night	before, when,	overwhelmed	in	a	tempest	of	love,	it	had	all	been	left	for	the	morning.	She filled	the	suit-case,	but	she	could	not	fasten	it.

"Come	and	help,	Peter,"	she	called.

He	came	out.	She	was	kneeling	on	it	in	her	loose	kimono,	her	hair	all	about	her, her	nightdress	open	at	the	throat.	He	drank	her	beauty	in,	and	then	mastered himself	for	a	minute	and	shut	the	case.	"That	all?"	she	queried.

"Yes,"	he	said.	"You	get	back	into	bed,	my	darling,	or	you'll	catch	cold.

I'll	be	ready	in	a	second,	and	then	we	can	have	a	few	minutes	together."

At	the	glass	he	marshalled	his	arguments,	and	then	he	came	over	to	her.	He dropped	by	the	bedside	and	wound	his	arms	about	her.	"Julie,"	he	whispered,

"my	darling,	say	you'll	marry	me—please, please!"

She	made	no	reply.	He	kissed	her,	unresisting,	again	and	again.

"Julie,"	he	said,	"you	know	how	I	love	you.	You	do	know	it.	You	know	I'm	not begging	you	to	marry	me	because	I've	got	something	out	of	you,	perhaps	when you	were	carried	away,	and	now	I	feel	I	must	make	reparation.	My	darling,	it isn't	that.	I	love	you	so	much	that	I	can't	live	without	you.	I'll	give	up	everything for	you.	I	want	to	start	a	new	life	with	you.	I	can't	go	back	to	the	old,	anyhow;	I don't	want	to:	it's	a	sham	to	me	now,	and	I	hate	shams—you	know	I	do.	But you're	not	a	sham;	our	love	isn't	a	sham.	I'd	die	for	you,	Julie,	my	own	Julie;	I'd die	for	the	least	little	bit	of	this	hair	of	yours,	I	think!	But	I	want	to	live	for	you.	I want	to	put	you	right	in	the	centre	of	everything,	and	live	for	you,	Julie.	Say

'Yes,'	my	love,	my	own.	You	must	say	'Yes,'	Why	don't	you,	Julie?"

And	still	she	made	no	reply.

A	kind	of	despair	seized	him.	"Oh,	Julie,"	he	cried,	"what	can	I	say	or	what	can	I do?	You're	cruel,	Julie;	you're	killing	me!	You	 must	say	'Yes'	before	I	go.	We'll meet	in	Havre,	I	know;	but	that	will	be	so	different.	I	must	have	my	answer	now.

Oh,	my	darling,	please,	please,	speak!	You	love	me,	Julie,	don't	you?"

"Peter,"	said	Julie	slowly,	"I	love	you	so	much	that	I	hardly	dare	speak,	lest	my love	should	carry	me	away.	But	listen,	my	dear,	listen.	Peter,	I've	watched	you these	days;	I've	watched	you	in	France.	I've	watched	you	from	the	moment	when I	called	you	over	to	me	because	I	was	interested	and	felt	my	fate,	I	suppose.	I've watched	you	struggling	along,	Peter,	and	I	understand	why	you've	struggled.

You're	built	for	great	things,	my	dear—how	great	I	can't	see	and	I	can't	even understand.	No,	Peter,	I	can't	even	understand—that's	part	of	the	tragedy	of	it.

Peter,	I	love	you	so	that	my	love	for	you	 is	my	centre,	it's	my	all	in	all,	it's	my hope	of	salvation,	Peter.	Do	you	hear,	my	darling?—my	love,	it's	my	one	hope!

If	I	can't	keep	that	pure	and	clean,	Peter,	I	ruin	both	of	us.	I	love	you	so,	Peter, that	I	won't	marry	you!"

He	gave	a	little	cry,	but	swiftly	she	put	a	hand	over	his	mouth.	She	smiled	at	him

as	she	did	so,	a	daring	little	smile.	"Be	quiet,	you	Solomon,	you,"	she	said;	"I haven't	finished.	There!	Now	listen	again,	Peter:	you	can't	help	it,	but	you	can't love	me	as	I	love	you.	I	see	it.	I—I	hate	it,	I	think;	but	I	know	it,	and	there's	an end.	You,	my	dear,	you	 would	put	me	in	the	centre,	but	you	can't.	I	can't	put	 you out	of	 my	centre,	Peter.	You	 would	give	up	God	for	me,	Peter,	but	you	can't,	or	if you	did,	you'd	lose	us	both.	But	I,	Peter—oh,	my	darling,	I	have	no	god	but	you.

And	that's	why	I'll	worship	you,	Peter,	and	sacrifice	to	you,	Peter,	sacrifice	to your	only	ultimate	happiness,	Peter,	and	sacrifice	my	all."

He	tried	to	speak,	but	he	could	not.	The	past	days	lay	before	him	in	a	clear	light at	last.	Her	love	shone	on	them,	and	shone	too	plainly	for	mistake.	He	tried	to deny,	but	he	couldn't;	contradict,	but	his	heart	cried	the	truth,	and	his	eyes	could not	hide	it.	But	he	could	and	did	vent	his	passion.	"Damn	God!	Curse	Him!"	he cried.	"I	hate	Him!	Why	should	He	master	me?	I	want	you,	Julie;	I	will	have you;	I	will	worship	 you,	Julie!"

She	let	him	speak;	and,	being	Julie,	his	words	only	brought	a	more	tender	light into	her	face.	"Peter,"	she	said,	"one	minute.	Do	you	remember	where	you	first kissed	me,	my	darling?—the	first	real	kiss,	I	mean,"	and	her	eyes	sparkled	with fun	even	then.	"You	know—ah,	I	see	you	do!	You	will	never	forget	that,	will you?	Perhaps	you	thought	I	didn't	notice,	but	I	did.	Neither	you	nor	I	chose	it;	it was	Fate;	perhaps	it	was	your	God,	Peter.	But,	anyway,	look	at	me	now	as	you looked	then.	What	do	you	see?"

He	stared	at	her,	and	he	saw—how	clearly	he	saw!	Her	sweet	back-bent	head, her	shining	eyes,	the	lamp-light	falling	on	her	hair	out	of	the	night.	He	even heard	the	sea	as	it	beat	on	the	stones	of	the	quay—or	thought	he	did—and	felt the	whip	of	the	wind.	And	behind	her,	dominating,	arms	outspread,	the	harbour crucifix.	And	she	saw	that	he	saw,	and	she	whispered:	" Do	you	hate	Him, Peter?"	And	he	sank	his	head	into	her	hands	and	sobbed	great	dry	sobs.

"Ah,	don't,	don't,"	he	heard	her	say—"don't	Peter!	It's	not	so	bad	as	that.	Your life	is	going	to	be	full,	my	beloved,	with	a	great	and	burning	love;	and	you	were right	this	morning,	Peter,	more	right	than	you	knew.	When	that	is	there	you	will have	place	even	for	me—yes,	even	for	me,	the	love	of	what	you	will	call	your sin.	And	I,	my	dear,	dear	boy,	I	have	something	even	now	which	no	devil,	Peter, and	no	god	can	take	away."

He	looked	up.	"Then	there's	a	chance,	Julie.	You	won't	say	'Yes,'	but	don't	say

'No.'	Let	us	see.	I	shall	take	no	vows,	Julie.	I	haven't	an	idea	what	I	shall	do,	and maybe	it	won't	be	quite	as	you	think,	and	there	will	be	a	little	room	for	you	one day.	Oh,	say	you'll	wait	a	while,	Julie,	just	to	see!"

It	was	the	supreme	moment.	She	saw	no	crucifix	to	sustain	her,	but	she	did	see the	bastard	Spanish	dancing-girl.	And	she	did	not	hesitate.	"No,	Peter,"	she	said,

"I	would	not	take	that,	and	you	never	could	give	it.	I	did	not	mean	such	place	as that.	It	never	can	be,	Peter;	you	are	not	made	for	me."

And	thus	did	Julie,	who	knew	no	God,	but	Julie	of	the	brave,	clean,	steadfast heart,	give	Peter	to	Him.

*	*	*	*	*

The	maid	came	in	answer	to	her	ring.	"Will	you	light	a	fire,	please?"	said	Julie.

"I	suppose	Captain	Graham	has	gone?"

"Yes,	mam,	he's	gone,	and	he	felt	it	terrible,	I	could	see.	But	don't	you	fear,	mam, he'll	be	kept,	I	know	he	will.	You're	that	good,	he'll	come	back	to	you,	never	fear.

But	it's	'ard	on	those	they	leave,	ain't	it,	mam?—their	wives	an'	all."

"Yes,"	said	Julie,	and	she	never	spoke	more	bravely.	"But	it's	got	to	be,	hasn't	it?

Would	you	pull	the	blind	up?	Ah,	thanks;	why,	it's	sunny!	I'm	so	glad.	It	will	be good	for	the	crossing."

"It	will	be	that,	'm.	We	gets	the	sun	first	up	here.	Shall	I	bring	up	the	tea, madame?"

"I'll	ring,"	said	Julie,	"when	I	want	it.	It	won't	be	for	a	few	minutes	yet."

The	girl	went	out,	and	the	door	shut	behind	her.	Julie	lay	on	still	for	a	little,	and then	she	got	up.	She	walked	to	the	window	and	looked	out,	and	she	threw	her arms	wide	with	a	gesture,	and	shut	her	eyes,	and	let	the	sun	fall	on	her.	Then	she walked	to	her	little	trunk,	and	rummaged	in	it.	From	somewhere	far	down	she drew	out	a	leather	case,	and	with	it	in	her	hand	she	went	over	and	sat	by	the	fire.

She	held	it	without	moving	for	a	minute,	and	then	she	slowly	opened	it.	One	by one	she	drew	out	a	few	worthless	things—a	withered	bunch	of	primroses,	a couple	of	little	scribbled	notes,	a	paper	cap	from	a	cracker,	a	menu	card,	a handkerchief	of	her	own	that	she	had	lent	to	him,	and	that	he	(just	like	Peter)	had given	back.	She	held	them	all	in	her	hand	a	minute,	and	then	she	bent	forward

and	dropped	them	in	the	open	fire.

And	the	sun	rose	a	little	higher,	and	fell	on	the	tumbled	brown	hair	that Peter	had	kissed	and	that	now	hid	her	eyes.

If	any	disclaimer	or limitation	set	forth	in	this	agreement	violates	the	law	of	the	state	applicable	to this	agreement,	the	agreement	shall	be	interpreted	to	make	the	maximum disclaimer	or	limitation	permitted	by	the	applicable	state	law.	The	invalidity	or unenforceability	of	any	provision	of	this	agreement	shall	not	void	the	remaining provisions.

Section	2.	Information	about	the	Mission	of	Project	Gutenberg-tm Project	Gutenberg-tm	is	synonymous	with	the	free	distribution	of	electronic works	in	formats	readable	by	the	widest	variety	of	computers	including	obsolete, old,	middle-aged	and	new	computers.

Section	4.	Information	about	Donations	to	the	Project	Gutenberg	Literary Archive	Foundation

Project	Gutenberg-tm	depends	upon	and	cannot	survive	without	wide	spread public	support	and	donations	to	carry	out	its	mission	of	increasing	the	number	of public	domain	and	licensed	works	that	can	be	freely	distributed	in	machine readable	form	accessible	by	the	widest	array	of	equipment	including	outdated equipment.	Many	small	donations	($1	to	$5,000)	are	particularly	important	to maintaining	tax	exempt	status	with	the	IRS.

The	Foundation	is	committed	to	complying	with	the	laws	regulating	charities and	charitable	donations	in	all	50	states	of	the	United	States.	Compliance requirements	are	not	uniform	and	it	takes	a	considerable	effort,	much	paperwork and	many	fees	to	meet	and	keep	up	with	these	requirements.	We	do	not	solicit donations	in	locations	where	we	have	not	received	written	confirmation	of compliance.	To	SEND	DONATIONS	or	determine	the	status	of	compliance	for any	particular	state	visit	http://pglaf.org

While	we	cannot	and	do	not	solicit	contributions	from	states	where	we	have	not met	the	solicitation	requirements,	we	know	of	no	prohibition	against	accepting unsolicited	donations	from	donors	in	such	states	who	approach	us	with	offers	to donate.

International	donations	are	gratefully	accepted,	but	we	cannot	make	any statements	concerning	tax	treatment	of	donations	received	from	outside	the United	States.	U.S.	laws	alone	swamp	our	small	staff.





Please	check	the	Project	Gutenberg	Web	pages	for	current	donation	methods	and addresses.	Donations	are	accepted	in	a	number	of	other	ways	including	including checks,	online	payments	and	credit	card	donations.	To	donate,	please	visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

CHAPTER X Part at least of Julie's programme was fulfilled to the letter, for they lay long in bed talking—desultory, reminiscent talk, which sent Peter's mind back over the months and the last few days, even after Julie was asleep in the bed next his. Like a pageant, he passed, in review scene after scene, turning it over, and wondering at significances that he had not before, imagined. He recalled their first meeting, that instantaneous attraction, and he asked himself what had caused it. Her spontaneity, freshness, and utter lack of conventionality, he supposed, but that did not seem to explain all. He wondered at the change that had even then come about in himself that he should have been so entranced by her, He went over his early hopes and fears; he thought again of conversations with Langton; and he realised afresh how true it was that the old authorities had dwindled away; that no allegiance had been left; that his had been a citadel without a master. And then Julie moved through his days again—Julie at Caudebec, daring, iconoclastic, free; Julie at Abbeville, mysterious, passionate, dominant; Julie at Dieppe—ah, Julie at Dieppe! He marvelled that he had held out so long after Dieppe, and then Louise rose before him. He understood Louise less than Julie, perhaps, and with all the threads in his hand he failed to see the pattern. He turned over restlessly. It was easy to see how they had come to be in London; it would have been more remarkable if they had not so come together; but now, what now? He could not sum up Julie amid the shifting scenes of the last few days. She had been so loving, and yet, in a way, their love had reached no climax. It had, indeed, reached what he would once have thought a complete and ultimate climax, but plainly Julie did not think so. And nor did he—now. The things of the spirit were, after all, so much greater than the things of the flesh. The Julie of Friday night had been his, but of this night…? He rolled over again. What had she meant at the play? He told himself her tears were simple emotion, her laughter simple reaction, but he knew it was not true….
