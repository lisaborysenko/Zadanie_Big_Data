I

INTRODUCING	MR.	IFF

At	 half-past	 two	 of	 a	 sunny,	 sultry	 afternoon	 late	 in	 the	 month	 of	 August,	 Mr.

Benjamin	 Staff	 sat	 at	 table	 in	 the	 dining-room	 of	 the	 Authors’	 Club,	 moodily munching	a	morsel	of	cheese	and	a	segment	of	cast-iron	biscuit	and	wondering

what	he	must	do	to	be	saved	from	the	death-in-life	of	sheer	ennui.

A	long,	lank	gentleman,	surprisingly	thin,	of	a	slightly	saturnine	cast:	he	was	not only	 unhappy,	 he	 looked	 it.	 He	 was	 alone	 and	 he	 was	 lonely;	 he	 was	 an American	and	a	man	of	sentiment	(though	he	didn’t	look	 that)	and	he	wanted	to go	home;	to	sum	up,	he	found	himself	in	love	and	in	London	at	one	and	the	same

time,	and	felt	precisely	as	ill	at	ease	in	the	one	as	in	the	other	of	these,	to	him, exotic	circumstances.

Inconceivable	as	it	may	seem	that	any	rational	man	should	yearn	for	New	York

in	 August,	 that	 and	 nothing	 less	 was	 what	 Staff	 wanted	 with	 all	 his	 heart.	 He wanted	to	go	home	and	swelter	and	be	swindled	by	taxicab	drivers	and	snubbed

by	 imported	 head-waiters;	 he	 wanted	 to	 patronise	 the	 subway	 at	 peril	 of asphyxiation	and	to	walk	down	Fifth	Avenue	at	that	witching	hour	when	electric

globes	 begin	 to	 dot	 the	 dusk	 of	 evening—pale	 moons	 of	 a	 world	 of	 steel	 and stone;	 he	 wanted	 to	 ride	 in	 elevators	 instead	 of	 lifts,	 in	 trolley-cars	 instead	 of trams;	he	wanted	to	go	to	a	ball-game	at	the	Polo	Grounds,	to	dine	dressed	as	he

pleased,	to	insult	his	intelligence	with	a	roof-garden	show	if	he	felt	so	disposed, and	 to	 see	 for	 himself	 just	 how	 much	 of	 Town	 had	 been	 torn	 down	 in	 the	 two months	of	his	exile	and	what	they	were	going	to	put	up	in	its	place.	He	wanted,

in	short,	his	own	people;	more	specifically	he	wanted	just	one	of	them,	meaning

to	marry	her	if	she’d	have	him.

Now	to	be	homesick	and	lovesick	all	at	once	is	a	tremendously	disturbing	state

of	affairs.	So	influenced,	the	strongest	men	are	prone	to	folly.	Staff,	for	instance, had	excellent	reason	to	doubt	the	advisability	of	leaving	London	just	then,	with

an	unfinished	play	on	his	hands;	but	he	was	really	no	more	than	a	mere,	normal

human	being,	and	he	did	want	very	badly	to	go	home.	If	it	was	a	sharp	struggle,

it	was	a	short	one	that	prefaced	his	decision.

Of	a	sudden	he	rose,	called	for	his	bill	and	paid	it,	called	for	his	hat	and	stick,

got	 them,	 and	 resolutely—yet	 with	 a	 furtive	 air,	 as	 one	 who	 would	 throw	 a dogging	 conscience	 off	 the	 scent—fled	 the	 premises	 of	 his	 club,	 shaping	 a course	through	Whitehall	and	Charing	Cross	to	Cockspur	Street,	where,	with	the

unerring	instinct	of	a	homing	pigeon,	he	dodged	hastily	into	the	booking-office

of	a	steamship	company.

Now	Mystery	is	where	one	finds	it,	and	Romantic	Adventure	is	as	a	rule	to	be

come	 upon	 infesting	 the	 same	 identical	 premises.	 Mr.	 Staff	 was	 not	 seeking mysteries	and	the	last	rôle	in	the	world	in	which	he	could	fancy	himself	was	that

of	 Romantic	 Adventurer.	 But	 in	 retrospect	 he	 can	 see	 quite	 clearly	 that	 it	 was there,	in	the	humdrum	and	prosaic	setting	of	a	steamship	booking-office,	that	he

first	stumbled	(all	unwittingly)	into	the	toils	of	his	Great	Adventure.

When	he	entered,	there	was	but	one	other	person	on	the	outer	or	public	side	of

the	 booking-counter;	 and	 he,	 sticking	 close	 in	 a	 far	 corner	 and	 inaudibly conferring	 with	 a	 clerk,	 seemed	 so	 slight	 and	 unpretending	 a	 body	 that	 Staff overlooked	his	existence	altogether	until	circumstances	obliged	him	to	recognise

it.

The	 ignored	 person,	 on	 the	 other	 hand,	 showed	 an	 instant	 interest	 in	 the appearance	of	Mr.	Staff.	You	might	have	thought	that	he	had	been	waiting	for	the

latter	to	come	in—absurd	as	this	might	seem,	in	view	of	the	fact	that	Staff	had

made	up	his	mind	to	book	for	home	only	within	the	last	quarter-hour.	None	the

less,	on	sight	of	him	this	other	patron	of	the	company,	who	had	seemed	till	then

to	be	of	two	minds	as	to	what	he	wanted,	straightened	up	and	bent	a	freshened

interest	on	the	cabin-plot	which	the	clerk	had	spread	out	upon	the	counter	for	his advisement.	 And	 a	 moment	 after	 Staff	 had	 audibly	 stated	 his	 wishes,	 the	 other prodded	a	certain	spot	of	the	chart	with	a	thin	and	fragile	forefinger.

“I’ll	take	this	one,”	he	said	quietly.

“Upper’r	lower?”	enquired	his	clerk.

“Lower.”

“Then-Q,”	said	the	clerk....

Meanwhile	 Staff	 had	 caught	 the	 eye	 of	 an	 impregnable	 young	 Englishman

behind	the	counter;	and,	the	latter	coming	forward,	he	opened	negotiations	with

a	succinct	statement:

“I	want	to	book	on	the	Autocratic,	sailing	tomorrow	from	Liverpool,	if	I’m	not

mistaken.”

“Quite	 so,”	 said	 his	 clerk,	 not	 without	 condescension.	 “For	 yourself,	 may	 I awsk?”

“For	myself	alone.”

“Then-Q.”	The	clerk	fetched	a	cabin-plot.

“I’m	 afraid,	 sir,”	 he	 said,	 removing	 a	 pencil	 from	 behind	 his	 ear	 the	 better	 to make	 his	 meaning	 clear,	 “there’s	 not	 much	 choice.	 It’s	 quite	 late	 to	 book,	 you know;	and	this	is	the	rush	season	for	westbound	traffic;	everything’s	just	about

full	up.”

“I	understand;	but	still	you	can	make	room	for	me	somewhere,	I	hope.”

“Oh,	yes.	Quite	so,	indeed.	It’s	only	a	question	of	what	you’d	like.	Now	we	have

a	 cabine	de	luxe—”

“Not	for	me,”	said	Staff	firmly.

“Then-Q....	 The	 only	 other	 accommodation	 I	 can	 offer	 you	 is	 a	 two-berth stateroom	on	the	main-deck.”

“An	outside	room?”

“Yes,	sir.	You	can	see	for	yourself.	Here	it	is:	berths	432	and	433.	You’ll	find	it quite	cosy,	I’m	sure.”

Staff	nodded,	eyeing	the	cubicle	indicated	by	the	pencil-point.

“That’ll	do,”	said	he.	“I’ll	take	it.”

“Then-Q.	Upper’r	lower	berth,	sir?”

“Both,”	said	Staff,	trying	not	to	look	conscious—and	succeeding.

“Both,	sir?”—in	tones	of	pained	expostulation.

“Both!”—reiterated	in	a	manner	that	challenged	curiosity.

“Ah,”	said	the	clerk	wearily,	“but,	you	see,	I	thought	I	understood	you	to	say	you were	alone.”

“I	did;	but	I	want	privacy.”

“I	see.	Then-Q.”—as	who	should	say:	 Another	mad	Amayrican.

With	this	the	clerk	took	himself	off	to	procure	a	blank	ticket.

While	he	waited,	Staff	was	entertained	by	snatches	of	a	colloquy	at	the	far	end	of the	 counter,	 where	 the	 other	 patron	 was	 being	 catechised	 as	 to	 his	 pedigree	 by the	other	booking-clerk.	What	he	heard	ran	something	to	the	following	effect:

“What	did	you	say	the	name	was,	sir?”

“The	name?”

“If	you	please—”

“What	name?”

“Your	name,	sir.”

“I	didn’t	say,	did	I?”

“No,	sir.”

“Ah!	I	thought	not.”

Pause;	then	the	clerk,	patiently:	“Do	you	mind	giving	me	your	name,	sir,	so	that	I may	fill	in	your	ticket?”

“I’d	r’ally	rather	not;	but	seein’	as	it’s	you	and	you	make	a	point	of	it—Iff.”

Pause....	“Beg	pardon?”

“Iff.”

“If	what,	sir?”

“I-double-F,	 Iff:	 a	 name,	 not	 a	 joke.	 I-F-F—William	 Howard	 Iff.	 W.	 H.	 Iff, Whiff:	joke.”

“Ow-w?”

“But	you	needn’t	laugh.”

With	dignity:	“I	was	not	intending	to	laugh,	sir.”

Staff	could	hardly	refrain	from	refreshing	himself	with	a	glance	at	the	individual so	singularly	labelled.	Appraising	him	covertly,	he	saw	a	man	whose	stature	was

quite	 as	 much	 shorter	 than	 the	 normal	 as	 his	 own	 was	 longer,	 but	 hardly	 less thin.	 Indeed,	 Staff	 was	 in	 the	 habit	 of	 defining	 his	 own	 style	 of	 architecture	 as Gothic,	 and	 with	 reasonable	 excuse;	 but	 reviewing	 the	 physical	 geography	 of Mr.	Iff,	the	word	 emaciation	bobbed	to	the	surface	of	the	literary	mentality:	Iff was	 really	 astonishingly	 slight	 of	 build.	 Otherwise	 he	 was	 rather	 round-shouldered;	 his	 head	 was	 small,	 bird-like,	 thinly	 thatched	 with	 hair	 of	 a	 faded tow	colour;	his	face	was	sensitively	tinted	with	the	faintest	of	flushes	beneath	a skin	of	natural	pallor,	and	wore	an	expression	curiously	naïve	and	yet	shrewd—

an	effect	manufactured	by	setting	the	eyes	of	a	child,	round	and	dimly	blue,	in	a

mask	of	weathered	maturity.

Now	 while	 Staff	 was	 receiving	 this	 impression,	 Mr.	 Iff	 looked	 sharply	 round; their	 glances	 crossed.	 Primarily	 embarrassed	 to	 be	 caught	 rudely	 staring,	 Staff was	next	and	thoroughly	shocked	to	detect	a	distinct	if	momentary	eclipse	of	one

of	 Mr.	 Iff’s	 pale	 blue	 eyes.	 Bluntly,	 openly,	 deliberately,	 Mr.	 Iff	 winked	 at	 Mr.

Staff,	and	then,	having	accomplished	his	amazement	and	discomfiture,	returned

promptly,	twinkling,	to	the	baiting	of	his	clerk.

“Your	age,	sir?”

Mr.	Iff	enquired	in	simple	surprise:	“Do	you	really	care	to	know?”

“It’s	required,	sir,	by	the—”

“Oh,	well—if	I	must!	But,	mind	you,	strictly	as	man	to	man:	you	may	write	me

down	a	freeborn	American	citizen,	entitled	to	vote	and	more	’n	half	white.”

“Beg	pardon?”

“I	say,	I	am	an	adult—”

“Oh!”	The	clerk	wrote;	then,	bored,	resumed:	“Married	or	single,	please?”

“I’m	a	spinster—”

“O-w?”

“Honestly—neither	married	nor	unmarried.”

“Then-Q”—resignedly.	“Your	business—?”

But	here	Staff’s	clerk	touched	the	exasperated	catechist	on	the	shoulder	and	said

something	inaudible.	The	response,	while	equally	inaudible,	seemed	to	convey	a

sense	 of	 profound	 personal	 shock.	 Staff	 was	 conscious	 that	 Mr.	 Iff’s	 clerk glanced	 reproachfully	 in	 his	 direction,	 as	 if	 to	 suggest	 that	 he	 wouldn’t	 have believed	it	of	him.

Divining	that	he	and	Mr.	Iff	were	bargaining	for	the	same	accommodations,	Staff

endeavoured	 to	 assume	 an	 attitude	 of	 distinguished	 obliviousness	 to	 the	 entire proceeding;	 and	 would	 have	 succeeded	 but	 for	 the	 immediate	 and	 impatient action	of	Mr.	Iff.

That	 latter,	 seizing	 the	 situation,	 glanced	 askance	 at	 dignified	 Mr.	 Staff,	 then smiled	a	whimsical	smile,	cocked	his	small	head	to	one	side	and	approached	him

with	an	open	and	ingenuous	air.

“If	it’s	only	a	question	of	which	berth,”	said	he,	“I’m	quite	willing	to	forfeit	my option	on	the	lower,	Mr.	Staff.”

That	gentleman	started	and	stared.

“Oh,	 lord,	 man!”	 said	 Iff	 tolerantly—“as	 if	 your	 portrait	 hadn’t	 been	 published more	 times	 than	 you	 can	 remember!—as	 if	 all	 the	 world	 were	 unaware	 of

Benjamin	Staff,	novelist!”

There	 was	 subtle	 flattery	 in	 this;	 and	 flattery	 (we	 are	 told)	 will	 warm	 the	 most austere	of	authors—which	Staff	was	not.	He	said	“Oh!”	and	smiled	his	slow,	wry

smile;	 and	 Mr.	 Iff,	 remarking	 these	 symptoms	 of	 a	 thaw	 with	 interest	 and encouragement,	pressed	his	point.

“I	 don’t	 mind	 an	 upper,	 really—only	 chose	 the	 lower	 because	 the	 choice	 was mine,	at	the	moment.	If	you	prefer	it—”

“The	trouble	is,”	Staff	interrupted,	“I	want	the	whole	room.”

“Oh!...	Friend	with	you?”

“No;	but	I	had	some	notion	of	doing	a	little	work	on	the	way	over.”

“Writing?	I	see.	But	if	that’s	all—!”	Mr.	Iff	routed	a	negligible	quibble	with	an

airy	flirt	of	his	delicate	hand.	“Trust	me;	you’ll	hardly	ever	be	reminded	of	my

existence—I’m	 that	quiet.	And	besides,	I	spend	most	of	my	time	in	the	smoking-room.	 And	 I	 don’t	 snore,	 and	 I’m	 never	 seasick....	 By	 the	 way,”	 he	 added anxiously,	“do	or	are	you?”

“Never—”

“Then	we’ll	get	along	famously.	I’ll	cheerfully	take	the	upper,	and	even	should	I tumble	 out	 on	 top	 of	 you,	 you’d	 never	 know	 it:	 my	 weight	 is	 nothing—hardly that.	Now	what	d’	you	say?	Is	it	a	go?”

“But—I	don’t	know	you—”

“Business	of	making	a	noise	like	an	Englishman!”	commented	Mr.	Iff	with	bitter

scorn.

“—well	enough	to	accept	such	a	favour	from	you.	I’ll	take	second	choice	myself

—the	upper,	I	mean.”

“You	 won’t;	 but	 we’ll	 settle	 that	 on	 shipboard,”	 said	 Mr.	 Iff	 promptly.	 “As	 for knowing	 me—business	 of	 introducing	 myself.	 Mr.	 Staff,	 I	 want	 you	 to	 shake hands	 with	 my	 friend,	 Mr.	 Iff.	 W.	 H.	 Iff,	 Whiff:	 sometimes	 so-called:	 merry wheeze	based	on	my	typographical	make-up;	once	a	joke,	now	so	grey	with	age

I	 generally	 pull	 it	 myself,	 thus	 saving	 new	 acquaintances	 the	 mental	 strain.

Practical	philanthropy—what?	Whim	of	mine.”

“Indeed?”

“Believe	 me.	You’ve	no	notion	how	folks	suffer	in	the	first	throes	of	that	giddy pun.	 And	 then	 when	 it	 falls	 flat—naturally	 I	 can’t	 laugh	 like	 a	 fool	 at	 it	 any longer— blooie! ”	said	Mr.	Iff	with	expression—“like	that— blooie! —they	 do	feel so	 cheap.	 Wherefore	 I	 maintain	 I	 do	 humanity	 a	 service	 when	 I	 beat	 it	 to	 that moth-eaten	joke.	You	follow	me?”

Staff	laughed.

“Then	it’s	all	settled.	Good!	We	shan’t	be	in	one	another’s	way.	You’ll	see.”

“Unless	you	talk	in	your	sleep,	too.”

Mr.	 Iff	 looked	 unspeakable	 reproach.	 “You’ll	 soon	 get	 accustomed	 to	 me,”	 he said,	 brightening—“won’t	 mind	 my	 merry	 prattle	 any	 more	 ’n	 the	 song	 of	 a giddy	humming-bird.”

He	 turned	 and	 saw	 their	 booking-clerks	 in	 patient	 waiting	 behind	 the	 counter.

“Ah,	there	you	are,	eh?	Well,	it’s	all	settled....”

Thus	was	the	thing	accomplished.

And	shortly	thereafter	these	two	paused	in	parting	at	the	door.

“Going	my	way?”	enquired	Mr.	Iff.

Staff	named	whatever	destination	he	had	in	mind.

“Sorry.	I	go	t’other	way.	Take	care	of	yourself.	See	you	tomorrow.”

“Good-bye,”	said	Staff,	and	took	himself	briskly	off.

But	 Mr.	 Iff	 did	 not	 at	 once	 go	 in	 the	 opposite	 direction.	 In	 fact,	 he	 moved	 no more	 than	 a	 door	 or	 two	 away,	 and	 then	 stopped,	 apparently	 fascinated	 by	 an especially	stupid	shop-window	show.

He	had	very	quick	eyes,	had	Mr.	Iff,	so	alert	and	observant	that	they	had	made

him	 alive	 to	 a	 circumstance	 which	 had	 altogether	 escaped	 Staff’s	 notice—a trifling	incident	that	took	place	just	as	they	were	on	the	point	of	parting.

While	 still	 they	 were	 standing	 in	 the	 doorway,	 a	 motor-cab,	 plunging	 down Haymarket,	had	swooped	in	a	wide	curve	as	if	meaning	to	pull	in	at	the	curb	in

front	of	the	steamship	company’s	office.	The	cab	carried	a	solitary	passenger—a

remarkably	pretty	young	woman—and	on	its	roof	a	remarkably	large	and	ornate

bandbox.

It	was,	in	fact,	the	bandbox	which	had	first	fixed	the	interest	of	Mr.	Iff.	Only	an introspective	vision,	indeed,	 such	 as	 that	 of	 the	 imaginative	 and	 thoughtful	 Mr.

Staff,	could	have	overlooked	the	approach	of	a	bandbox	so	big	and	upstanding,

so	profusely	beflowered	and	so	prominently	displayed.

Now	 before	 the	 cab	 could	 stop,	 its	 fare,	 who	 had	 been	 bending	 forward	 and peering	out	of	the	window	as	if	anxious	to	recognise	her	destination,	started	still farther	 forward,	 seized	 the	 speaking-tube	 and	 spoke	 into	 its	 mouthpiece	 in	 a manner	 of	 sharp	 urgency.	 And	 promptly	 the	 driver	 swerved	 out	 from	 the	 curb and	swung	his	car	away	down	Pall	Mall.

If	it	was	mere	inquisitiveness	that	held	Mr.	Iff	rooted	to	the	spot,	gaping	at	that uninteresting	 window	 show,	 it	 served	 to	 discover	 him	 in	 the	 guise	 of	 an admirably	patient	person.	Fully	fifteen	minutes	elapsed	before	the	return	of	the

motor-cab	was	signalled	unmistakably	by	the	blatant	bandbox	bobbing	back	high

above	the	press	of	traffic.	And	when	this	happened,	Mr.	Iff	found	some	further

business	 with	 the	 steamship	 company,	 and	 quietly	 and	 unobtrusively	 slipped back	into	the	booking-office.

As	he	did	so	the	cab	stopped	at	the	curb	and	the	pretty	young	woman	jumped	out

and	 followed	 Mr.	 Iff	 across	 the	 threshold—noticing	 him	 no	 more	 than	 had	 Mr.

Staff,	to	begin	with.





II

THE	BANDBOX

In	the	playhouses	of	France,	a	hammering	on	the	stage	alone	heralds	the	rising	of

the	 curtain	 to	 disclose	 illusory	 realms	 of	 romance.	 Precisely	 so	 with	 Mr.	 Staff, upon	 the	 door	 of	 whose	 lodging,	 at	 nine	 o’clock	 the	 next	 morning,	 a	 knocking announced	the	first	overt	move	against	his	peace	of	mind.

At	that	time,	Staff,	all	unconscious	of	his	honourable	peril,	was	standing	in	the

middle	of	the	floor	of	the	inner	room	(his	lodgings	comprised	two)	and	likewise

in	 the	 approximate	 geographical	 centre	 of	 a	 chaotic	 assemblage	 of	 assorted wearing	apparel	and	other	personal	impedimenta.

He	was	wondering,	confusedly,	how	in	thunderation	he	was	to	manage	to	cram

all	that	confounded	truck	into	the	limited	amount	of	trunk	space	at	his	command.

He	 was	 also	 wondering,	 resentfully	 in	 the	 names	 of	 a	 dozen	 familiar	 spirits, where	he	had	put	his	pipe:	it’s	simply	maddening,	the	way	a	fellow’s	pipe	will

persist	 in	 getting	 lost	 at	 such	 critical	 times	 as	 when	 he’s	 packing	 up	 to	 catch	 a train	 with	 not	 a	 minute	 to	 spare....	 In	 short,	 so	 preoccupied	 was	 Staff	 that	 the knocking	had	to	be	repeated	before	he	became	objectively	alive	to	it.

Then,	confidentially,	he	said:	“What	the	devil	 now?”

In	 louder	 tones	 calculated	 to	 convey	 an	 impression	 of	 intense	 impatience,	 he cried:	“Come	 in!”

He	heard	the	outer	door	open,	and	immediately,	upon	an	impulse	esoteric	even	in

his	own	understanding,	he	chose	to	pretend	to	be	extravagantly	busy—as	busy	as

by	rights	he	should	have	been.	For	a	minute	or	longer	he	acted	most	vividly	the

part	of	a	man	madly	bent	on	catching	his	train	though	he	were	to	perish	of	the

attempt.	And	this	despite	a	suspicion	that	he	played	to	a	limited	audience	of	one, and	 that	 one	 unappreciative	 of	 the	 finer	 phases	 of	 everyday	 histrionic

impersonation:	an	audience	answering	to	the	name	of	Milly,	whose	lowly	station

of	 life	 was	 that	 of	 housemaid-in-lodgings	 and	 whose	 imagination	 was	 as	 ill-nourished	and	sluggish	as	might	be	expected	of	one	whose	wages	were	two-and-

six	a	week.

Remembering	this	in	time,	the	novelty	of	make-believe	palled	on	Staff.	Not	that

alone,	 but	 he	 could	 hear	 Milly	 insisting	 in	 accents	 not	 in	 the	 least	 apologetic:

“Beg	pardon,	sir	...”

He	paused	in	well-feigned	surprise	and	looked	enquiringly	over	his	shoulder,	as

though	 to	 verify	 a	 surmise	 that	 somebody	 had	 spoken.	 Such	 proving	 to	 be	 the case,	 he	 turned	 round	 to	 confront	 Milly—Milly	 true	 to	 type,	 wearing	 a	 grimy matutinal	apron,	an	expression	half	sleepy,	half	sullen,	and	a	horrid	soot	smudge

on	her	ripe,	red,	right	cheek.

In	 this	 guise	 (so	 sedulously	 does	 life	 itself	 ape	 the	 conventions	 of	 its	 literature and	 drama)	 Milly	 looked	 as	 lifelike	 as	 though	 viewed	 through	 the	 illusion	 of footlights.	Otherwise,	as	Staff	never	failed	to	be	gratified	to	observe,	she	differed radically	 from	 the	 stock	 article	 of	 our	 stage.	 For	 one	 thing,	 she	 refrained	 from dropping	 her	 aitches	 and	 stumbling	 over	 them	 on	 her	 first	 entrance	 in	 order merely	to	win	a	laugh	and	so	lift	her	little	rôle	from	the	common	rut	of	“lines”	to the	 dignity	 of	 “a	 bit.”	 For	 another,	 she	 seldom	 if	 ever	 brandished	 that	 age-honoured	 wand	 of	 her	 office,	 a	 bedraggled	 feather-duster.	 Nor	 was	 she	 by	 any means	in	love	with	the	tenant	of	the	fust-floor-front.

But	 though	 Staff	 was	 grateful	 for	 Milly	 because	 of	 this	 strong	 and

unconventional	 individuality	 of	 hers,	 he	 wasn’t	 at	 all	 pleased	 to	 be	 interrupted, and	he	made	nothing	whatever	of	the	ostensible	excuse	for	the	interruption;	the

latter	 being	 a	 very	 large	 and	 brilliantly	 illuminated	 bandbox,	 which	 Milly	 was offering	him	in	pantomime.

“It	 have	 just	 come,”	 said	 Milly	 calmly,	 in	 response	 to	 his	 enquiring	 stare.

“Where	would	you	wish	me	to	put	it,	sir?”

“Put	what?”

Milly	gesticulated	eloquently	with	the	bandbox.

“That	thing?”	said	Staff	with	scorn.

“Yessir.”

“I	don’t	want	you	to	put	it	anywhere.	Take	it	away.”

“But	it’s	for	you,	sir.”

“Impossible.	 Some	 mistake.	 Please	 don’t	 bother—just	 take	 it	 away.	 There’s	 a good	girl.”

Milly’s	disdain	of	this	blandishment	was	plainly	visible	in	the	added	elevation	of her	already	sufficiently	tucked-up	nose.

“Beg	pardon,	sir,”	she	persisted	coldly,	“but	it’s	got	your	nime	on	it,	and	the	boy as	left	it	just	now	asked	if	you	lived	here.”

Staff’s	frown	portrayed	indignation,	incredulity	and	impatience.

“Mistake,	I	tell	you.	I	haven’t	been	buying	any	millinery.	Absurd!”

“Beg	pardon,	sir,	but	you	can	see	as	it’s	addressed	to	you.”

It	 was:	 the	 box	 being	 held	 out	 for	 examination,	 Staff	 saw	 plainly	 that	 it	 was tagged	with	a	card	inscribed	in	fashionably	slapdash	feminine	handwriting	with

what	was	unquestionably	the	name	and	local	address	of	Benjamin	Staff,	Esq.

Because	of	this,	he	felt	called	upon	to	subject	the	box	to	more	minute	inspection.

It	was	nothing	more	nor	less	than	the	everyday	milliners’	hat-box	of	commerce:

a	capacious	edifice	of	stout	pasteboard	neatly	plastered	with	wall-paper	in	whose

design	 narrow	 stripes	 of	 white	 alternated	 with	 aggressive	 stripes	 of	 brown,	 the whole	effectively	setting	off	an	abundance	of	purple	blossoms	counterfeiting	no

flower	 known	 to	 botanists.	 And	 one	 gibbous	 side	 was	 further	 decorated	 with bold	black	script	advertising	the	establishment	of	its	origin.

“Maison	 Lucille,	 New	 Bond	 Street,	 West,”	 Staff	 read	 aloud,	 completely bewildered.	“But	I	never	heard	of	the	d——	the	place!”

Helplessly	he	sought	Milly’s	eyes,	and	helpfully	Milly	rose	to	the	occasion.

“Nossir,”	said	she;	and	that	was	all.

“I	 know	 nothing	 whatever	 about	 the	 thing,”	 Staff	 declared	 severely.	 “It’s	 all	 a mistake.	Take	it	away—it’ll	be	sent	for	as	soon	as	the	error’s	discovered.”

A	 glimmer	 of	 intelligence	 shone	 luminous	 in	 Milly’s	 eyes.	 “Mebbe,”	 she

suggested	 under	 inspiration	 of	 curiosity—“Mebbe	 if	 you	 was	 to	 open	 it,	 you’d find	a	note	or—or	something.”

“Bright	 girl!”	 applauded	 Staff.	 “You	 open	 it.	 I’m	 too	 busy—packing	 up—no time—”

And	 realising	 how	 swiftly	 the	 golden	 minutes	 were	 fleeting	 beyond	 recall,	 he cast	desperately	about	for	his	pipe.

By	some	miracle	he	chanced	to	find	it,	and	so	resumed	packing.

Behind	him,	Milly	made	noises	with	tissue-paper.

Presently	 he	 heard	 a	 smothered	 “O	 sir!”	 and	 looked	 round	 to	 discover	 the housemaid	in	an	attitude	of	unmitigated	adoration	before	what	he	could	not	deny

was	a	perfect	dream	of	a	hat—the	sort	of	a	hat	that	only	a	woman	or	a	society

reporter	 could	 do	 justice	 to.	 In	 his	 vision	 it	 bore	 a	 striking	 resemblance	 to	 a Gainsborough	with	all	modern	improvements—as	most	big	hats	do	to	most	men.

Briefly,	 it	 was	 big	 and	 black	 and	 trimmed	 with	 an	 atmosphere	 of	 costly simplicity,	a	monstrous	white	“willow”	plume	and	a	huge	buckle	of	brilliants.	It

impressed	 him,	 hazily,	 as	 just	 the	 very	 hat	 to	 look	 ripping	 on	 an	 ash-blonde.

Aside	 from	 this	 he	 was	 aware	 of	 no	 sensation	 other	 than	 one	 of	 aggravated annoyance.

Milly,	to	the	reverse	extreme,	was	charmed	to	distraction,	thrilled	to	the	core	of her	 and	 breathless—though	 by	 no	 means	 dumb.	 Women	 are	 never	 dumb	 with

admiration.

“O	sir!”	she	breathed	in	ecstasy—“it’s	a	real	creashun!”

“Daresay,”	Staff	conceded	sourly.	“Did	you	find	a	note?”

“And	the	price-tag,	sir—it	says	 twen-ty	five	pounds!”

“I	hope	there’s	a	receipted	bill,	then....	Do	you	see	anything	remotely	resembling a	note—or	something?”

With	difficulty	subduing	her	transports—“I’ll	see,	sir,”	said	Milly.

Grunting	with	exasperation,	Staff	bent	over	a	trunk	and	stuffed	things	into	it	until Milly	 committed	 herself	 to	 the	 definite	 announcement:	 “I	 don’t	 seem	 to	 find nothing,	sir.”

“Look	again,	please.”

Again	Milly	pawed	the	tissue-paper.

“There	ain’t	nothing	at	all,	sir,”	she	declared	finally.

Staff	 stood	 up,	 thrust	 his	 hands	 into	 his	 pockets	 and	 champed	 the	 stem	 of	 his pipe—scowling.

“It	is	a	bit	odd,	sir,	isn’t	it?—having	this	sent	to	you	like	this	and	you	knowing nothing	at	all	about	it!”

Staff	said	something	indistinguishable	because	of	the	obstructing	pipe-stem.

“It’s	perfectly	beautiful,	sir—a	won’erful	hat,	really.”

“The	devil	fly	away	with	it!”

“Beg	pardon,	sir?”

“I	said,	I’m	simply	crazy	about	it,	myself.”

“Oh,	did	you,	sir?”

“Please	put	it	back	and	tie	it	up.”

“Yessir.”	 Reluctantly	 Milly	 restored	 the	 creation	 to	 its	 tissue-paper	 nest.	 “And what	would	you	wish	me	to	do	with	it	now,	sir?”	she	resumed	when	at	length	the

ravishing	vision	was	hidden	away.

“Do	 with	 it?”	 stormed	 the	 vexed	 gentleman.	 “I	 don’t	 care	 what	 the	 d—ickens you	do	with	it.	It	isn’t	my	hat.	Take	it	away.	Throw	it	into	the	street.	Send	it	back to	the	place	it	came	from.	Give	it	...	or,	wait!”

Pausing	for	breath	and	thought,	he	changed	his	mind.	The	hat	was	too	valuable

to	 be	 treated	 with	 disrespect,	 no	 matter	 who	 was	 responsible	 for	 the	 mistake.

Staff	felt	morally	obligated	to	secure	its	return	to	the	Maison	Lucille.

“Look	here,	Milly	...”

“Yessir?”

“I’ll	just	telephone	...	No!	Half	a	minute!”

He	 checked,	 on	 the	 verge	 of	 yielding	 to	 an	 insane	 impulse.	 Being	 a	 native	 of New	York,	it	had	been	his	instinctive	thought	to	call	up	the	hat-shop	and	demand

the	return	of	its	delivery-boy.	Fortunately	the	instinct	of	a	true	dramatist	moved him	to	sketch	hastily	the	ground-plot	of	the	suggested	tragedy.

In	 Act	I	( Time:	the	Present)	 he	 saw	 himself	 bearding	 the	 telephone	 in	 its	 lair—

that	is,	in	the	darkest	and	least	accessible	recess	of	the	ground-floor	hallway.	In firm,	manful	accents,	befitting	an	intrepid	soul,	he	details	a	number	to	the	central operator—and	 meekly	 submits	 to	 an	 acidulated	 correction	 of	 his	 Amurrikin

accent.

Act	II	( fifteen	minutes	have	elapsed):	He	is	clinging	desperately	to	the	receiver, sustained	by	hope	alone	while	he	attends	sympathetically	to	the	sufferings	of	an

English	lady	trying	to	get	in	communication	with	the	Army	and	Navy	Stores.

Act	 III	 ( ten	 minutes	 later):	 He	 has	 exhausted	 himself	 grinding	 away	 at	 an obsolete	 rotary	 bell-call.	 Abruptly	 his	 ears	 are	 enchanted	 by	 a	 far,	 thin,	 frigid moan.	 It	 says:	 “Are	 you	 theah?”	 Responding	 savagely	 “NO!”	 he	 dashes	 the receiver	back	into	its	hook	and	flings	away	to	discover	that	he	has	lost	both	train and	steamer.	Tag	line:	For	this	is	London	in	the	Twentieth	Century. Curtain:	End of	the	Play. ...

Disenchanted	 by	 consideration	 of	 this	 tentative	 synopsis,	 the	 playwright

consulted	his	watch.	Already	the	incident	of	the	condemnable	bandbox	had	eaten

up	much	invaluable	time.	He	would	see	himself	doomed	to	unending	perdition	if

he	would	submit	to	further	hindrance	on	its	behalf.

“Milly,”	said	he	with	decision,	“take	that	...	thing	down-stairs,	and	tell	Mrs.	Gigg to	telephone	the	hat-shop	to	call	for	it.”

“Yessir.”

“And	after	that,	call	me	a	taxi.	Tell	it	to	wait.	I’ll	be	ready	by	ten	or	know—”

Promptly	 retiring,	 Milly	 took	 with	 her,	 in	 addition	 to	 the	 bandbox,	 a	 confused impression	of	a	room	whose	atmosphere	was	thick	with	flying	garments,	in	the

wild	 swirl	 of	 which	 a	 lanky	 lunatic	 danced	 weirdly,	 muttering	 uncouth

incantations....

Forty	minutes	later	(on	the	stroke	of	ten)	Mr.	Staff,	beautifully	groomed	after	his habit,	his	manner	(superbly	nonchalant)	denying	that	he	had	ever	known	reason

why	 he	 should	 take	 a	 single	 step	 in	 haste,	 followed	 his	 trunks	 down	 to	 the sidewalk	 and,	 graciously	 bidding	 his	 landlady	 adieu,	 presented	 Milly	 with	 a keepsake	in	the	shape	of	a	golden	coin	of	the	realm.

A	 taxicab,	 heavy-laden	 with	 his	 things,	 fretted	 before	 the	 door.	 Staff	 nodded	 to the	driver.

“Euston,”	said	he;	“and	a	shilling	extra	if	you	drive	like	sin.”

“Right	you	are,	sir.”

In	the	act	of	entering	the	cab,	Staff	started	back	with	bitter	imprecations.

Mrs.	 Gigg,	 who	 had	 not	 quite	 closed	 the	 front	 door,	 opened	 it	 wide	 to	 his remonstrant	voice.

“I	say,	what’s	this	bandbox	doing	in	my	cab?	I	thought	I	told	Milly—”

“Sorry,	sir;	I	forgot,”	Mrs.	Gigg	interposed—“bein’	that	flustered—”

“Well?”

“The	 woman	 what	 keeps	 the	 ’at-shop	 said	 as	 ’ow	 the	 ’at	 wasn’t	 to	 come	 back, sir.	 She	 said	 a	 young	 lidy	 bought	 it	 yestiddy	 ahfternoon	 and	 awsked	 to	 ’ave	 it sent	you	this	mornin’	before	nine	o’clock.”

“The	deuce	she	did!”	said	Staff	blankly.

“An’	the	young	lidy	said	as	’ow	she’d	write	you	a	note	explynin’.	So	I	tells	Milly not	to	bother	you	no	more	abaht	it,	but	put	the	’at-box	in	the	keb,	sir—wishin’

not	to	’inder	you.”

“Thoughtful	 of	 you,	 I’m	 sure.	 But	 didn’t	 the—ah—woman	 who	 keeps	 the	 hat-shop	mention	the	name	of	the—ah—person	who	purchased	the	hat?”

By	 the	 deepening	 of	 its	 corrugations,	 the	 forehead	 of	 Mrs.	 Gigg	 betrayed	 the intensity	of	her	mental	strain.	Her	eyes	wore	a	far-away	look	and	her	lips	moved,

at	first	silently.	Then—“I	ain’t	sure,	sir,	as	she	did	nime	the	lidy,	but	 if	she	did,	it was	somethin’	like	Burnside,	I	fancy—or	else	Postlethwayt.”

“Nor	Jones	nor	Brown?	Perhaps	Robinson?	Think,	Mrs.	Gigg!	Not	Robinson?”

“I’m	sure	it	may	’ave	been	eyether	of	them,	sir,	now	you	puts	it	to	me	pl’in.”

“That	makes	everything	perfectly	clear.	Thank	you	so	much.”

With	this,	Staff	turned	hastily	away,	nodded	to	his	driver	to	cut	along,	and	with

groans	and	lamentations	squeezed	himself	into	what	space	the	bandbox	did	not

demand	of	the	interior	of	the	vehicle.





III

TWINS

On	 the	 boat-train,	 en	 route	 for	 Liverpool,	 Mr.	 Staff	 found	 plenty	 of	 time	 to consider	the	affair	of	the	foundling	bandbox	in	every	aspect	with	which	a	lively

imagination	 could	 invest	 it;	 but	 to	 small	 profit.	 In	 fact,	 he	 was	 able	 to	 think	 of little	else,	with	the	damned	thing	smirking	impishly	at	him	from	its	perch	on	the

opposite	 seat.	 He	 was	 vexed	 to	 exasperation	 by	 the	 consciousness	 that	 he couldn’t	guess	why	or	by	whom	it	had	been	so	cavalierly	thrust	into	his	keeping.

Consequently	 he	 cudgelled	 his	 wits	 unmercifully	 in	 exhaustive	 and	 exhausting attempts	to	clothe	it	with	a	plausible	 raison	d’être.

He	believed	firmly	that	the	Maison	Lucille	had	acted	in	good	faith;	the	name	of

Staff	was	too	distinctive	to	admit	of	much	latitude	for	error.	Nor	was	it	difficult to	conceive	that	this	or	that	young	woman	of	his	acquaintance	might	have	sent

him	the	hat	to	take	home	for	her—thus	ridding	herself	of	a	cumbersome	package

and	 neatly	 saddling	 him	 with	 all	 the	 bother	 of	 getting	 the	 thing	 through	 the customs.	But	...!	Who	was	there	in	London	just	then	that	knew	him	well	enough

so	to	presume	upon	his	good	nature?	None	that	he	could	call	to	mind.	Besides,

how	in	the	name	of	all	things	inexplicable	had	anybody	found	out	his	intention

of	 sailing	 on	 the	 Autocratic,	 that	 particular	 day?—something	 of	 which	 he himself	had	yet	to	be	twenty-four	hours	aware!

His	 conclusions	 may	 be	 summed	 up	 under	 two	 heads:	 (a)	 there	 wasn’t	 any answer;	(b)	it	was	all	an	unmitigated	nuisance.	And	so	thinking,	divided	between

despair	and	disgust,	Mr.	Staff	gave	the	problem	up	against	his	arrival	on	board

the	 steamship.	 There	 remained	 to	 him	 a	 single	 gleam	 of	 hope:	 a	 note	 of explanation	 had	 been	 promised;	 he	 thought	 it	 just	 possible	 that	 it	 might	 have been	sent	to	the	steamship	rather	than	to	his	lodgings	in	London.

Therefore,	 the	 moment	 he	 set	 foot	 aboard	 the	 ship,	 he	 consigned	 his	 hand-luggage	to	a	steward,	instructing	the	fellow	where	to	take	it,	and	hurried	off	to

the	dining-saloon	where,	upon	a	table	round	which	passengers	buzzed	like	flies

round	a	sugar-lump,	letters	and	telegrams	for	the	departing	were	displayed.	But

he	could	find	nothing	for	Mr.	Benjamin	Staff.

Disappointed	and	indignant	to	the	point	of	suppressed	profanity,	he	elbowed	out

of	the	thronged	saloon	just	in	time	to	espy	a	steward	(quite	another	steward:	not him	with	whom	Staff	had	left	his	things)	struggling	up	the	main	companionway

under	 the	 handicap	 of	 several	 articles	 of	 luggage	 which	 Staff	 didn’t	 recognise, and	one	which	he	assured	himself	he	did:	a	bandbox	as	like	the	cause	of	all	his

perturbation	as	one	piano-case	resembles	another.

Now	if	quite	out	of	humour	with	the	bandbox	and	all	that	appertained	thereunto,

the	temper	of	the	young	man	was	such	that	he	was	by	no	means	prepared	to	see

it	 confiscated	 without	 his	 knowledge	 or	 consent.	 In	 two	 long	 strides	 he overhauled	the	steward,	plucked	him	back	with	a	peremptory	hand,	and	abashed

him	with	a	stern	demand:

“I	say!	where	the	devil	do	you	think	you’re	going,	my	man?”

His	man	showed	a	face	of	dashed	amazement.

“Beg	pardon,	sir!	Do	you	mean	 me?”

“Most	certainly	I	mean	you.	That’s	my	bandbox.	What	are	you	doing	with	it?”

Looking	guiltily	from	his	face	to	the	article	in	question,	the	steward	flushed	and stammered—culpability	incarnate,	thought	Staff.

“Your	bandbox,	sir?”

“Do	you	think	I’d	go	charging	all	over	this	ship	for	a	silly	bandbox	that	wasn’t

mine?”

“But,	sir—”

“I	 tell	 you,	 it’s	 mine.	 It’s	 tagged	 with	 my	 name.	 Where’s	 the	 steward	 I	 left	 it with?”

“But,	sir,”	pleaded	the	accused,	“this	belongs	to	this	lidy	’ere.	I’m	just	tikin’	it	to

’er	stiteroom,	sir.”

Staff’s	gaze	followed	the	man’s	nod,	and	for	the	first	time	he	became	aware	that

a	young	woman	stood	a	step	or	two	above	them,	half	turned	round	to	attend	to

the	 passage,	 her	 air	 and	 expression	 seeming	 to	 indicate	 a	 combination	 of amusement	and	impatience.

Precipitately	 the	 young	 man	 removed	 his	 hat.	 Through	 the	 confusion	 clouding his	 thoughts,	 he	 both	 foreglimpsed	 humiliation	 and	 was	 dimly	 aware	 of	 a

personality	of	force	and	charm:	of	a	well-poised	figure	cloaked	in	a	light	pongee travelling-wrap;	 of	 a	 face	 that	 seemed	 to	 consist	 chiefly	 in	 dark	 eyes	 glowing lambent	in	the	shadow	of	a	wide-brimmed,	flopsy	hat.	He	was	sensitive	to	a	hint

of	 breeding	 and	 reserve	 in	 the	 woman’s	 attitude;	 as	 though	 (he	 thought)	 the contretemps	diverted	and	engaged	her	more	than	he	did	who	was	responsible	for

it.

He	addressed	her	in	a	diffident	and	uncertain	voice:	“I	beg	pardon....”

“The	 box	 is	 mine,”	 she	 affirmed	 with	 a	 cool	 and	 even	 gravity.	 “The	 steward	 is right.”

He	choked	back	a	counterclaim,	which	would	have	been	unmannerly,	and	in	his

embarrassment	 did	 something	 that	 he	 instantly	 realised	 was	 even	 worse,

approaching	downright	insolence	in	that	it	demanded	confirmation	of	her	word:

he	bent	forward	and	glanced	at	the	tag	on	the	bandbox.

It	was	labelled	quite	legibly	with	the	name	of	Miss	Eleanor	Searle.

He	 coloured,	 painfully	 contrite.	 “I’m	 sorry,”	 he	 stammered.	 “I—ah—happen	 to have	 with	 me	 the	 precise	 duplicate	 of	 this	 box.	 I	 didn’t	 at	 first	 realise	 that	 it might	have	a—ah—twin.”

The	young	woman	inclined	her	head	distantly.

“I	understand,”	she	said,	turning	away.	“Come,	steward,	if	you	please.”

“I’m	very	sorry—very,”	Staff	said	hastily	in	intense	mortification.

Miss	 Searle	 did	 not	 reply;	 she	 had	 already	 resumed	 her	 upward	 progress.	 Her steward	followed,	openly	grinning.

Since	it	is	not	considered	good	form	to	kick	a	steward	for	knowing	an	ass	when

he	meets	one,	Staff	could	no	more	than	turn	away,	disguise	the	unholy	emotions

that	fermented	in	his	heart,	and	seek	his	stateroom.

“It	 had	to	be	me!”	he	groaned.

Stateroom	432-433	proved	to	be	very	much	occupied	when	he	found	it—chiefly,

to	be	sure,	by	the	bandbox,	which	took	up	most	of	the	floor	space.	Round	it	were

grouped	 in	 various	 attitudes	 of	 dejection	 sundry	 other	 pieces	 of	 travelling-gear and	Mr.	Iff.	The	latter	was	sitting	on	the	edge	of	the	lower	berth,	his	hands	in	his pockets,	his	brow	puckered	with	perplexity,	his	gaze	fixed	in	fascination	to	the

bandbox.	On	Staff’s	entrance	he	looked	up.

“Hello!”	he	said	crisply.

“Afternoon,”	 returned	 Staff	 with	 all	 the	 morose	 dignity	 appropriate	 to	 severely wounded	self-esteem.

Iff	indicated	the	bandbox	with	a	delicate	gesture.

“No	wonder,”	he	observed	mildly,	“you	wanted	the	ship	to	yourself.”

Staff	 grunted	 irritably	 and,	 picking	 his	 way	 through	 and	 over	 the	 mound	 of luggage,	deposited	himself	on	the	transom	opposite	the	berths.

“A	present	for	the	missis,	I	take	it?”	pursued	Iff.

“You	might	take	it,	and	welcome,	for	all	of	me....	Only	it	isn’t	mine. And	I	am not	married.”

“Pardon!”	 murmured	 Mr.	 Iff.	 “But	 if	 it	 isn’t	 yours,”	 he	 suggested	 logically,

“what	the	deuce-and-all	is	it	doing	here?”

“I’m	supposed	to	be	taking	it	home	for	a	friend.”

“Ah!	I	see....	A	very, very	dear	friend,	of	course....?”

“You’d	 think	 so,	 wouldn’t	 you?”	 Staff	 regarded	 the	 bandbox	 with	 open

malevolence.	“If	I	had	my	way,”	he	said	vindictively,	“I’d	lift	it	a	kick	over	the side	and	be	rid	of	it.”

“How	 you	 do	 take	 on,	 to	 be	 sure,”	 Iff	 commented	 placidly.	 “If	 I	 may	 be permitted	to	voice	my	inmost	thought:	you	seem	uncommon’	peeved.”

“I	am.”

“Could	I	soothe	your	vexed	soul	in	any	way?”

“You	might	tell	me	how	to	get	quit	of	the	blasted	thing.”

“I’ll	try,	if	you’ll	tell	me	how	you	got	hold	of	it.”

“Look	 here!”	 Staff	 suddenly	 aroused	 to	 a	 perception	 of	 the	 fact	 that	 he	 was	 by way	 of	 being	 artfully	 pumped.	 “Does	 this	 matter	 interest	 you	 very	 much

indeed?”

“No	more,	apparently,	than	it	annoys	you....	And	it	is	quite	possible	that,	in	the course	 of	 time,	 we	 might	 like	 to	 shut	 the	 door....	 But,	 as	 far	 as	 that	 is,	 I	 don’t mind	admitting	I’m	a	nosey	little	beast.	If	you	feel	it	your	duty	to	snub	me,	my

dear	fellow,	by	all	means	go	to	it.	I	don’t	mind—and	I	dessay	I	deserve	it.”

This	proved	irresistible;	Staff’s	humour	saved	his	temper.	To	the	twinkle	in	Iff’s faded	blue	eyes	he	returned	a	reluctant	smile	that	ended	in	open	laughter.

“It’s	 just	 this	 way,”	 he	 explained	 somewhat	 to	 his	 own	 surprise,	 under	 the influence	of	an	unforeseen	gush	of	liking	for	this	good-humoured	wisp	of	a	man

—“I	feel	I’m	being	shamelessly	imposed	upon.	Just	as	I	was	leaving	my	rooms

this	 morning	 this	 hat-box	 was	 sent	 to	 me,	 anonymously.	 I	 assume	 that	 some cheeky	 girl	 I	 know	 has	 sent	 it	 to	 me	 to	 tote	 home	 for	 her.	 It’s	 a	 certificated nuisance—but	that	isn’t	all.	There	happens	to	be	a	young	woman	named	Searle

on	 board,	 who	 has	 an	 exact	 duplicate	 of	 this	 infernal	 contraption.	 A	 few moments	ago	I	saw	it,	assumed	it	must	be	mine,	quite	naturally	claimed	it,	and

was	properly	called	down	in	the	politest,	most	crushing	way	imaginable.	Hence

this	headache.”

“So!”	said	Mr.	Iff.	“So	that	is	why	he	doesn’t	love	his	dear	little	bandbox!...	A

Miss	Earle,	I	think	you	said?”

“No—Searle.	At	least,	that	was	the	name	on	her	luggage.”

“Oh—Searle,	eh?”

“You	don’t	happen	to	know	her,	by	any	chance?”	Staff	demanded,	not	without	a

trace	of	animation.

“Who?	Me?	Nothing	like	that,”	Iff	disclaimed	hastily.

“I	just	thought	you	might,”	said	Staff,	disappointed.

For	some	moments	the	conversation	languished.	Then	Staff	rose	and	pressed	the

call-button.

“What’s	up?”	asked	Iff.

“Going	to	get	rid	of	this,”	said	Staff	with	an	air	of	grim	determination.

“Just	what	I	was	going	to	suggest.	But	don’t	do	anything	hasty—anything	you’ll

be	sorry	for.”

“Leave	that	to	me,	please.”

From	 his	 tone	 the	 assumption	 was	 not	 unwarrantable	 that	 Staff	 had	 never	 yet done	 anything	 that	 he	 had	 subsequently	 found	 cause	 to	 regret.	 Pensively

punishing	an	inoffensive	wrist,	Iff	subsided.

A	steward	showed	himself	in	the	doorway.

“You	rang,	sir?”

“Are	you	our	steward?”	asked	Staff.

“Yes,	sir.”

“Your	name?”

“Orde,	sir.”

“Well,	Orde,	can	you	stow	this	thing	some	place	out	of	our	way?”

Orde	eyed	the	bandbox	doubtfully.	“I	dessay	I	can	find	a	plice	for	it,”	he	said	at length.

“Do,	please.”

“Very	good,	sir.	Then-Q.”	Possessing	himself	of	the	bandbox,	Orde	retired.

“And	 now,”	 suggested	 Iff	 with	 much	 vivacity,	 “s’pose	 we	 unpack	 and	 get

settled.”

And	 they	 proceeded	 to	 distribute	 their	 belongings,	 sharing	 the	 meagre

conveniences	of	their	quarters	with	the	impartiality	of	courteous	and	experienced

travellers....

It	 was	 rather	 late	 in	 the	 afternoon	 before	 Staff	 found	 an	 opportunity	 to	 get	 on deck	for	the	first	time.	The	hour	was	golden	with	the	glory	of	a	westering	sun.

The	 air	 was	 bland,	 the	 sea	 quiet.	 The	 Autocratic	 had	 settled	 into	 her	 stride, bearing	 swiftly	 down	 St.	 George’s	 Channel	 for	 Queenstown,	 where	 she	 was

scheduled	 to	 touch	 at	 midnight.	 Her	 decks	 presented	 scenes	 of	 animation

familiar	to	the	eyes	of	a	weathered	voyager.

There	 was	 the	 customary	 confusion	 of	 petticoats	 and	 sporadic	 displays	 of steamer-rugs	 along	 the	 ranks	 of	 deck-chairs.	 Deck-stewards	 darted	 hither	 and yon,	wearing	the	harassed	expressions	appropriate	to	persons	of	their	calling—

doubtless	 to	 a	 man	 praying	 for	 that	 bright	 day	 when	 some	 public	 benefactor should	invent	a	steamship	having	at	least	two	leeward	sides.	A	clatter	of	tongues

assailed	the	ear,	the	high,	sweet	accents	of	American	women	predominating.	The

masculine	 element	 of	 the	 passenger-list	 with	 singular	 unanimity—like	 birds	 of prey	 wheeling	 in	 ever	 diminishing	 circles	 above	 their	 quarry—drifted

imperceptibly	but	steadily	aft,	toward	the	smoking-room.	The	two	indispensable

adjuncts	 to	 a	 successful	 voyage	 had	 already	 put	 in	 their	 appearance:	 item,	 the Pest,	 an	 overdressed,	 overgrown,	 shrill-voiced	 female-child,	 blundering	 into everybody’s	 way	 and	 shrieking	 impertinences; item,	 a	 short,	 stout,	 sedulously hilarious	 gentleman	 who	 oozed	 public-spirited	 geniality	 at	 every	 pore	 and insisted	on	buttonholing	inoffensive	strangers	and	demanding	that	they	enter	an

embryonic	deck-quoit	tournament—in	short,	discovering	every	known	symptom

of	being	the	Life	and	Soul	of	the	Ship.

Staff	dodged	both	by	grace	of	discretion	and	good	fortune,	and	having	found	his

deck-chair,	dropped	into	it	with	a	sigh	of	content,	composing	himself	for	rest	and thought.	His	world	seemed	very	bright	with	promise,	just	then;	he	felt	that,	if	he had	 acted	 on	 impetuous	 impulse,	 he	 had	 not	 acted	 unwisely:	 only	 a	 few	 more hours—then	the	pause	at	Queenstown—then	the	brief,	seven-day	stretch	across

the	Atlantic	to	home	and	Alison	Landis!

It	seemed	almost	too	good	to	be	true.	He	all	but	purred	with	his	content	in	the

prospect.

Of	 course,	 he	 had	 a	 little	 work	 to	 do,	 but	 he	 didn’t	 mind	 that;	 it	 would	 help immensely	to	beguile	the	tedium	of	the	voyage;	and	all	he	required	in	order	to	do

it	well	was	the	moral	courage	to	shut	himself	up	for	a	few	hours	each	day	and	to

avoid	as	far	as	possible	social	entanglements....

At	just	about	this	stage	in	his	meditations	he	was	somewhat	rudely	brought	back

to	earth—or,	more	properly,	to	deck.

A	voice	shrieked	excitedly:	“Why,	Mr.	Staff!”

To	 be	 precise,	 it	 miscalled	 him	 “Stahf”:	 a	 shrill,	 penetrating,	 overcultivated, American	voice	making	an	attempt	only	semi-successful	to	cope	with	the	broad

vowels	of	modern	English	enunciation.

Staff	looked	up,	recognised	its	owner,	and	said	beneath	his	breath:	“O	Lord!”—

his	 soul	 crawling	 with	 recognition.	 But	 nothing	 of	 this	 was	 discernible	 in	 the alacrity	with	which	he	jumped	up	and	bent	over	a	bony	but	bedizened	hand.

“Mrs.	Ilkington!”	he	said.

“R’ally,”	said	the	lady,	“the	world	 is	ve-ry	small,	isn’t	it?”

She	 was	 a	 lean,	 angular,	 inordinately	 vivacious	 body	 whose	 years,	 which	 were many	more	than	forty,	were	making	a	brave	struggle	to	masquerade	as	thirty.	She

was	 notorious	 for	 her	 execrable	 taste	 in	 gowns	 and	 jewelry,	 but	 her	 social position	was	impregnable,	and	her	avowed	mission	in	life	was	to	bring	together

Society	 (meaning	 the	 caste	 of	 money)	 with	 the	 Arts	 (meaning	 those	 humble souls	content	to	sell	their	dreams	for	the	wherewithal	to	sustain	life).

Her	passion	for	bromidioms	always	stupefied	Staff—left	him	dazed	and	witless.

In	 the	 present	 instance	 he	 could	 think	 of	 nothing	 by	 way	 of	 response	 happier than	that	hoary	banality:	“This	is	indeed	a	surprise.”

“Flatterer!”	said	Mrs.	Ilkington	archly.	“I’m	not	surprised,”	she	pursued.	“I	might have	known	 you’d	be	aboard	this	vessel.”

“You	must	be	a	prophetess	of	sorts,	then,”	he	said,	smiling.	“I	didn’t	know	I	was

going	to	sail,	myself,	till	late	yesterday	afternoon.”

“Deceiver,”	commented	the	lady	calmly.	“Why	can’t	you	men	 ever	be	candid?”

Surprise	merged	into	some	annoyance.	“What	do	you	mean?”	he	asked	bluntly.

“Oh,	but	two	can	play	at	that	game,”	she	assured	him	spiritedly.	“If	you	won’t	be

open	with	me,	why	should	I	tell	all	I	know?”

“I’m	sure	I	don’t	know	what	you’re	driving	at,	Mrs.	Ilkington.”

“Would	it	improve	your	understanding”—she	threatened	him	gaily	with	a	gem-

encrusted	 forefinger—“if	 I	 were	 to	 tell	 you	 I	 met	 a	 certain	 person	 in	 Paris	 last week,	who	talked	to	me	about	you?”

“It	would	not,”	said	he	stiffly.	“Who—?”

“Oh,	well,	if	you	 won’t	be	frank!”	Mrs.	Ilkington’s	manner	implied	that	he	was	a bold,	 bad	 butterfly,	 but	 that	 she	 had	 his	 entomological	 number,	 none	 the	 less.

“Tell	me,”	she	changed	the	subject	abruptly,	“how	goes	the	 great	play?”

“Three	acts	are	written,”	he	said	in	weariness	of	spirit,	“the	fourth—”

“But	I	thought	you	weren’t	to	return	to	America	until	it	was	 quite	finished?”

“Who	told	you	that,	please?”

“Never	mind,	sir!	How	about	the	fourth	act?”

“I	 mean	 to	 write	 it	 en	 voyage,”	 said	 he,	 perplexed.	 From	 whom	 could	 this woman	possibly	have	learned	so	much	that	was	intimate	to	himself?

“You	have	it	all	mapped	out,	then?”	she	persisted.

“Oh,	yes;	it	only	needs	to	be	put	on	paper.”

“R’ally,	 then,	 it’s	 true—isn’t	 it—that	 the	 writing	 is	 the	 least	 part	 of	 play construction?”

“Who	told	you	that?”	he	asked	again,	this	time	amused.

“Oh,	a	 very	prominent	man,”	she	declared;	and	named	him.

Staff	laughed.	“A	too	implicit	belief	in	that	theory,	Mrs.	Ilkington,”	said	he,	“is responsible	for	the	large	number	of	perfectly	good	plays	that	somehow	never	get

written—to	 say	 nothing	 of	 the	 equally	 large	 number	 of	 perfectly	 good

playwrights	who	somehow	never	get	anywhere.”

“Clever!”	screamed	the	lady.	“But	aren’t	you	wasteful	of	your	epigrams?”

He	 could	 cheerfully	 have	 slain	 her	 then	 and	 there;	 for	 which	 reason	 the	 civil gravity	he	preserved	was	all	the	more	commendable.

“And	now,”	he	persisted,	“won’t	you	tell	me	with	whom	you	were	discussing	me

in	Paris?”

She	shook	her	head	at	him	reprovingly.	“You	don’t	 know?”

“No.”

“You	can’t	guess?”

“Not	to	save	me.”

“R’ally?”

“Honestly	 and	 truly,”	 he	 swore,	 puzzled	 by	 the	 undertone	 of	 light	 malice	 he thought	to	detect	in	her	manner.

“Then,”	 said	 she	 with	 decision,	 “I’m	 not	 going	 to	 get	 myself	 into	 trouble	 by

babbling.	But,	if	you	promise	to	be	 nice	to	me	all	the	way	home—?”	She	paused.

“I	promise,”	he	said	gravely.

“Then—if	 you	 happen	 to	 be	 at	 the	 head	 of	 the	 companion-ladder	 when	 the tender	comes	off	from	Queenstown	tonight—I	promise	you	a	 huge	surprise.”

“You	won’t	say	more	than	that?”	he	pleaded.

She	 appeared	 to	 debate.	 “Yes,”	 she	 announced	 mischievously;	 “I’ll	 give	 you	 a leading	hint.	The	person	I	mean	is	the	purchaser	of	the	Cadogan	collar.”

His	eyes	were	blank.	“And	what,	please,	is	the	Cadogan	collar?”

“You	don’t	mean	to	tell	me	you’ve	never	 heard	of	it?”	She	paused	with	dramatic effect.	“Incredible!	Surely,	everybody	knows	about	the	Cadogan	collar,	the	most

magnificent	necklace	of	pearls	in	the	world!”

“Everybody,	it	seems,	but	myself,	Mrs.	Ilkington.”

“R’ally!”	 she	 cried,	 and	 tapped	 his	 arm	 playfully.	 “You	 are	 as	 stupid	 as	 most brilliant	men!”

A	bugle	sang	through	the	evening	air.	The	lady	started	consciously.

“Heavens!”	 she	 cried.	 “Time	 to	 dress	 for	 dinner:	 I	 must	 fly!...	 Have	 you	 made your	table	reservation	yet?”

“Yes,”	he	said	hastily.

“Then	 do	 see	 the	 second-steward	 at	 once	 and	 get	 transferred	 to	 our	 table;	 we have	just	one	vacant	chair.	Oh,	but	you	 must;	you’ve	promised	to	be	nice	to	me, you	know.	And	I	do	so	want	you	to	meet	one	of	my	protégées—such	a	 sweet	girl

—a	 Miss	 Searle.	 I’m	 sure	 you’ll	 be	 crazy	 about	 her—at	 least,	 you	 would	 be	 if there	were	no	Alison	Landis	in	your	cosmos.	Now,	do	attend	to	that	right	away.

Remember	you’ve	promised.”

Staff	bowed	as	she	fluttered	away.	In	his	heart	he	was	thoroughly	convinced	that

this	 were	 a	 sorry	 scheme	 of	 things	 indeed	 did	 it	 not	 include	 a	 special	 hell	 for Mrs.	Ilkingtons.

What	had	she	meant	by	her	veiled	references	to	this	mysterious	person	in	Paris,

who	was	to	board	the	steamer	at	Queenstown?	How	had	she	come	by	so	much

personal	knowledge	of	himself	and	his	work?	And	what	did	she	know	about	his

love	for	Alison	Landis?

He	 swore	 thoughtfully,	 and	 went	 below	 to	 dress,	 stopping	 on	 the	 way	 to	 make arrangements	 with	 the	 second-steward	 to	 have	 his	 seat	 changed,	 in	 accordance with	his	exacted	promise.





IV

QUEENSTOWN

Immediately	 he	 had	 allowed	 himself	 to	 be	 persuaded,	 Staff	 felt	 sure	 he	 should not	 have	 agreed	 to	 change	 his	 seat	 to	 the	 table	 occupied	 by	 Mrs.	 Ilkington’s party,	 especially	 if	 he	 meant	 sincerely	 to	 try	 to	 do	 any	 real	 work	 aboard	 the Autocratic;	and	it	wasn’t	long	after	he	had	taken	his	place	for	the	first	dinner	that he	was	convinced	that	he	had	blundered	beyond	remedy	or	excuse.

The	 table	 was	 round	 and	 seated	 seven,	 though	 when	 the	 party	 had	 assembled there	 remained	 two	 vacant	 places.	 Staff	 was	 assigned	 the	 chair	 on	 Mrs.

Ilkington’s	right	and	was	sensitive	to	a	not	over	subtle	implication	that	his	was

the	 seat	 of	 honour.	 He	 would	 cheerfully	 have	 exchanged	 it	 for	 a	 place	 on	 the lady’s	left,	which	would	have	afforded	a	chance	to	talk	to	Miss	Searle,	to	whom

he	 earnestly	 desired	 to	 make	 an	 explanation	 and	 such	 amends	 as	 she	 would permit.	 But	 a	 male	 person	 named	 Bangs,	 endowed	 with	 impressive	 self-assurance,	 altogether	 too	 much	 good-looks	 (measured	 by	 the	 standards	 of	 the dermatological	 institute	 advertisements)	 and	 no	 excess	 baggage	 in	 the	 way	 of intellect,	 sat	 on	 Mrs.	 Ilkington’s	 left,	 with	 Miss	 Searle	 beyond	 him.	 The	 latter had	suffered	Staff	to	be	presented	to	her	with	(he	fancied)	considerable	repressed amusement.	Not	that	he	blamed	her,	but	...

His	 position	 was	 rendered	 unhappy	 to	 the	 verge	 of	 being	 impossible,	 however, by	the	lady	on	his	own	right,	a	Mrs.	Thataker:	darkly	temperamental	and	buxom,

a	divorcée	and	(she	lost	no	time	in	telling	him)	likewise	a	playwright.	True,	none of	 her	 plays	 had	 ever	 been	 produced;	 but	 that	 was	 indisputably	 due	 to	 a managerial	 conspiracy;	 what	 she	 really	 needed	 was	 a	 friend	 at	 court—some clever	 man	 having	 “the	 ear	 of	 the	 manager.”	 (Staff	 gathered	 that	 a	 truly	 clever man	 could	 warm	 up	 a	 play	 and	 pour	 it	 into	 the	 ear	 of	 the	 managers	 like laudanum	 and	 sweet-oil.)	 With	 such	 a	 man,	 he	 was	 given	 to	 understand,	 Mrs.

Thataker	wouldn’t	mind	collaborating;	she	had	manuscripts	in	her	steamer-trunk

which	were	calculated	to	prove	a	number	of	things	...

And	while	he	was	easing	away	and	preparing	to	run	before	the	wind	to	escape

any	such	hideous	 complication,	he	was	 abruptly	brought	up	 all-standing	by	the

information	that	the	colour	of	the	lady’s	soul	was	pink.	She	knew	this	to	be	a	fact beyond	 dispute,	 because	 she	 never	 could	 do	 her	 best	 work	 save	 when	 garbed

exclusively	 in	 pink.	 She	 enumerated	 several	 articles	 of	 wearing	 apparel	 not customarily	 discussed	 between	 comparative	 strangers	 but	 which—always

provided	 they	 were	 pink—she	 held	 indispensable	 to	 the	 task	 of	 dramatic

composition.

In	 his	 great	 agony,	 happening	 to	 glance	 in	 Miss	 Searle’s	 direction,	 he	 saw	 her with	head	bent	and	eyelids	lowered,	lips	compressed,	colour	a	trifle	heightened,

shoulders	suspiciously	a-quiver.

Incongruously,	 the	 impression	 obtruded	 that	 they	 were	 unusually	 handsome

shoulders.

For	that	matter,	she	was	an	unusually	handsome	young	woman:	tall,	fair,	with	a

face	featured	with	faint,	exquisite	irregularity,	brown	eyes	and	brows	in	striking contrast	 to	 the	 rich	 golden	 colour	 of	 her	 hair;	 well-poised	 and	 balanced—sure but	not	too	conscious	of	herself	...

Staff	 heard	 himself	 saying	 “Beg	 pardon?”	 to	 a	 third	 repetition	 of	 one	 of	 Mrs.

Thataker’s	gratuitous	revelations.

At	this	he	took	fright,	drew	back	into	his	reserve	for	the	remainder	of	the	meal,

and	 as	 soon	 as	 he	 decently	 could,	 made	 his	 excuses	 and	 fled	 to	 join	 Iff	 in	 the smoking-room....

He	 found	 the	 little	 man	 indulging	 his	 two	 passions;	 he	 was	 drinking	 whiskey-and-sodas	and	playing	bridge,	both	in	the	most	masterly	fashion.	Staff	watched

the	 game	 a	 while	 and	 then,	 the	 opportunity	 offering,	 cut	 in.	 He	 played	 till	 ten o’clock,	 at	 which	 hour,	 wearied,	 he	 yielded	 his	 seat	 to	 another,	 leaving	 Mr.	 Iff the	 victor	 of	 six	 rubbers	 and	 twelve	 whiskey-and-sodas.	 As	 Staff	 went	 out	 on deck	 the	 little	 man	 cut	 for	 the	 seventh	 and	 ordered	 the	 thirteenth.	 Neither indulgence	seemed	to	have	had	any	perceptible	effect	upon	him.

Staff	 strolled	 forward,	 drinking	 in	 air	 that	 seemed	 the	 sweeter	 by	 contrast	 with the	reeking	room	he	had	just	quitted.	The	wind	had	freshened	since	nightfall;	it

blew	strong	and	cool,	but	not	keen.	And	there	was	more	motion	in	the	seas	that

sang	overside,	wrapped	in	Cimmerian	blackness.	The	sky	had	become	overcast;

there	were	no	stars:	only	the	’longshore	lights	of	Ireland	twinkled,	small,	bright, incredibly	 distant	 over	 the	 waters.	 The	 decks	 were	 softly	 aglow	 with	 electric lights,	lending	a	deeper	shade	of	velvety	denseness	to	the	night	beyond	the	rails.

He	hadn’t	moved	far	forward	when	his	quick	sight	picked	out	the	shimmer	of	a

woman’s	 hair,	 like	 spun	 gold,	 about	 amidships	 in	 the	 rank	 of	 deck-chairs.	 He made	sure	it	was	Miss	Searle;	and	it	was.	She	sat	alone,	with	none	near	her,	her

head	resting	against	the	back	of	the	chair,	her	face	turned	a	trifle	forward;	so	that she	was	unaware	of	his	approach	until	he	stopped	before	her.

“Miss	Searle—”	he	began	diffidently.

She	looked	up	quickly	and	smiled	in	what	he	thought	a	friendly	way.

“Good	evening,”	said	she;	and	moved	her	body	slightly	in	the	deck-chair,	turning

a	little	to	the	left	as	if	expecting	him	to	take	the	vacant	chair	on	that	hand.

He	 did	 so	 without	 further	 encouragement,	 and	 abruptly	 found	 himself	 wholly lacking	 words	 wherewith	 to	 phrase	 what	 he	 had	 in	 mind	 to	 say.	 In	 such emergency	he	resorted	to	an	old,	tried	and	true	trick	of	his	and	began	to	talk	on

the	first	subject,	unrelated	to	his	dilemma,	that	popped	into	his	head.

“Are	you	a	good	sailor?”	he	enquired	gravely.

The	girl	nodded.	“Very.”

“Not	afraid	of	seasickness?”

“No.	Why?”

“Because,”	said	Staff	soberly,	“I’ve	been	praying	for	a	hurricane.”

She	nodded	again	without	speaking,	her	eyes	alone	questioning.

“Mrs.	Thataker,”	he	pursued	evenly,	“confided	to	me	at	dinner	that	she	is	a	very

poor	sailor	indeed.”

Miss	Searle	laughed	quietly.	“You	desire	a	punishment	to	fit	the	crime.”

“There	 are	 some	 crimes	 for	 which	 no	 adequate	 punishment	 has	 ever	 been

contrived,”	 he	 returned,	 beginning	 to	 see	 his	 way,	 and	 at	 the	 same	 time beginning	to	think	himself	uncommonly	clever.

“Oh!”	said	Miss	Searle	with	a	little	laugh.	“Now	if	you’re	leading	up	to	a	second

apology	about	that	question	of	the	bandbox,	you	needn’t,	because	I’ve	forgiven

you	already.”

He	glanced	at	her	reproachfully.	“You	just	naturally	had	to	beat	me	to	that,	didn’t you?”	he	complained.	“All	the	same,	it	 was	inexcusable	of	me.”

“Oh,	no;	I	quite	understood.”

“You	 see,”	 he	 persisted	 obstinately,	 “I	 really	 did	 think	 it	 was	 my	 bandbox.	 I actually	have	got	one	with	me,	precisely	like	yours.”

“I	quite	believed	you	the	first	time.”

Something	in	her	tone	moved	him	to	question	her	face	sharply;	but	he	found	her

shadowed	eyes	inscrutable.

“I	half	believe	you	know	something,”	he	ventured,	perplexed.

“Perhaps,”	she	nodded,	with	an	enigmatic	smile.

“What	do	you	know?”

“Why,”	she	said,	“it	was	simple	enough.	I	happened	to	be	in	Lucille’s	yesterday

afternoon	when	a	hat	was	ordered	delivered	to	you.”

“You	were!	Then	you	know	who	sent	it	to	me?”

“Of	course.”	Her	expression	grew	curious.	“Don’t	you?”

“No,”	he	said	excitedly.	“Tell	me.”

But	she	hesitated.	“I’m	not	sure	I	ought	...”

“Why	not?”

“It’s	none	of	my	affair—”

“But	surely	you	must	see	...	Listen:	I’ll	tell	you	about	it.”	He	narrated	succinctly the	intrusion	of	the	mysterious	bandbox	into	his	ken,	that	morning.	“Now,	a	note

was	 promised;	 it	 must	 have	 miscarried.	 Surely,	 there	 can	 be	 no	 harm	 in	 your telling	me.	Besides,	I’ve	a	right	to	know.”

“Possibly	...	but	I’m	not	sure	I’ve	a	right	to	tell.	Why	should	I	be	a	spoil-sport?”

“You	 mean,”	 he	 said	 thoughtfully—“you	 think	 it’s	 some	 sort	 of	 a	 practical joke?”

“What	do	you	think?”

“Hmm-mm,”	said	Staff.	And	then,	“I	don’t	like	to	be	made	fun	of,”	he	asserted,	a trace	sulkily.

“You	 are	 certainly	 a	 dangerously	 original	 man,”	 said	 Miss	 Searle—“almost abnormal.”

“The	most	unkindest	slam	of	all,”	he	murmured.

He	made	himself	look	deeply	hurt.	The	girl	laughed	softly.	He	thought	it	rather

remarkable	 that	 they	 should	 enjoy	 so	 sympathetic	 a	 sense	 of	 humour	 on	 such short	acquaintance....

“But	you	forgive	me?”

“Oh,	yes,”	he	said	generously;	“only,	of	course,	I	couldn’t	help	feeling	it	a	bit—

coming	from	 you.”

“From	me?”	Miss	Searle	sat	up	in	her	deck-chair	and	turned	to	him.	“Mr.	Staff!

you’re	not	flirting	with	me?”

“Heaven	forfend!”	he	cried,	so	sincerely	that	both	laughed.

“Because,”	said	she,	sinking	back,	“I	must	warn	you	that	Mrs.	Ilkington	has	been

talking	...”

“Oh,”	he	groaned	from	his	heart—“damn	that	woman!”

There	 was	 an	 instant	 of	 silence;	 then	 he	 stole	 a	 contrite	 look	 at	 her	 immobile profile	and	started	to	get	up.

“I—Miss	Searle,”	he	stammered—“I	beg	your	pardon	...”

“Don’t	go,”	she	said	quietly;	“that	is,	unless	you	want	to.	My	silence	was	simply

sympathetic.”

He	 sat	 back.	 “Thank	 you,”	 he	 said	 with	 gratitude;	 and	 for	 some	 seconds considered	 the	 case	 of	 Mrs.	 Ilkington,	 not	 charitably	 but	 with	 murder	 in	 his bosom.	 “Do	 you	 mean,”	 he	 resumed	 presently,	 “she	 has—ah—connected	 my

name	with—”

“Yes,”	nodded	the	girl.

“‘Something	 lingering	 in	 boiling	 oil,’”	 he	 mused	 aloud,	 presently....	 “What staggers	 me	 is	 how	 she	 found	 out;	 I	 was	 under	 the	 impression	 that	 only	 the persons	most	concerned	knew	about	it.”

“Then	it’s	true?	You	are	engaged	to	marry	Miss	Landis?	Or	is	that	an	impertinent

question?”	 Without	 pause	 the	 girl	 answered	 herself:	 “Of	 course	 it	 is;	 only	 I couldn’t	help	asking.	Please	forget	I	spoke—”

“Oh,	 I	 don’t	 mind,”	 he	 said	 wearily;	 “now	 that	 Mrs.	 Ilkington	 has	 begun	 to distribute	 handbills.	 Only	 ...	 I	 don’t	 know	 that	 there’s	 a	 regular,	 hard-and-fast engagement:	just	an	understanding.”

“Thank	 you,”	 said	 Miss	 Searle.	 “I	 promise	 not	 to	 speak	 of	 it	 again.”	 She hesitated	an	instant,	then	added:	“To	you	or	anybody	else.”

“You	 see,”	 he	 went	 on	 after	 a	 little,	 “I’ve	 been	 working	 on	 a	 play	 for	 Miss Landis,	 under	 agreement	 with	 Jules	 Max,	 her	 manager.	 They	 want	 to	 use	 it	 to open	Max’s	newest	Broadway	theatre	late	this	autumn.	That’s	why	I	came	across

—to	find	a	place	in	London	to	bury	myself	in	and	work	undisturbed.	It	means	a

good	deal	to	me—to	all	of	us—this	play....	But	what	I’m	getting	at	is	this:	Alison

—Miss	Landis—didn’t	leave	the	States	this	summer;	Mrs.	Ilkington	(she	told	me

at	dinner)	left	New	York	before	I	did.	So	how	in	Heaven’s	name—?”

“I	 had	 known	 nothing	 of	 Mrs.	 Ilkington	 at	 all,”	 said	 Miss	 Searle	 cautiously,

“until	we	met	in	Paris	last	month.”

He	was	conscious	of	the	hint	of	uneasiness	in	her	manner,	but	inclined	to	assign

it	to	the	wrong	cause.

“I	trust	I	haven’t	bored	you,	Miss	Searle—talking	about	myself.”

“Oh,	 no;	 indeed	 no.	 You	 see—”	 she	 laughed—“I	 quite	 understand;	 I	 keep	 a temperament	of	my	 own—if	you	should	 happen	to	wonder	 why	Mrs.	Ilkington

interests	 herself	 in	 me.	 I’m	 supposed	 to	 have	 a	 voice	 and	 to	 be	 in	 training	 for grand	opera.”

“Not	really?”

And	again	she	laughed.	“I’m	afraid	there	isn’t	any	cure	for	me	at	this	late	date,”

she	 protested;	 “I’ve	 gone	 so	 far	 I	 must	 go	 farther.	 But	 I	 know	 what	 you	 mean.

People	 who	 sing	 are	 difficult.	 However	 ...”	 She	 stirred	 restlessly	 in	 her	 chair, then	sat	up.

“What	is	that	light	over	there?”	she	asked.	“Do	you	know?”

Staff’s	 gaze	 sought	 the	 indicated	 direction.	 “Roches	 Point,	 I	 imagine;	 we’re about	due	at	Queenstown	...”

“As	late	as	that?”	The	girl	moved	as	if	to	rise.	Staff	jumped	up	and	offered	her	a hand.	 In	 a	 moment	 she	 was	 standing	 beside	 him.	 “I	 must	 go	 below,”	 said	 she.

“Good	night.”

“You	 won’t	 tell	 me	 who	 it	 was	 in	 Lucille’s,	 yesterday?”	 he	 harked	 back pleadingly.

She	 shook	 her	 head	 gaily	 as	 she	 turned	 forward	 to	 the	 main	 companionway entrance:	“No;	you	must	find	out	for	yourself.”

“But	perhaps	it	isn’t	a	practical	joke?”

“Then— perhaps—I	shall	tell	you	all—sometime.”

He	paused	by	the	raised	door-sill	as	she	stepped	within	the	superstructure.	“Why

not	stop	up	and	see	the	tender	come	off?”	he	suggested.	“It	might	be	interesting.”

She	flashed	him	a	look	of	gay	malice.	“If	we’re	to	believe	Mrs.	Ilkington,	you’re

apt	to	find	it	more	interesting	than	I.	Good	night.”

“Oh—good	night!”	he	muttered,	disturbed;	and	turned	away	to	the	rail.

His	 troubled	 vision	 ranged	 far	 to	 the	 slowly	 shifting	 shore	 lights.	 The	 big steamship	 had	 come	 very	 close	 inshore—as	 witness	 the	 retarded	 speed	 with which	she	crept	toward	her	anchorage—but	still	the	lights,	for	all	their	singular

brightness,	seemed	distant,	incalculably	far	away;	the	gulf	of	blackness	that	set

them	 apart	 exaggerated	 all	 distances	 tenfold.	 The	 cluster	 of	 sparks	 flanked	 by green	 and	 red	 that	 marked	 the	 hovering	 tender	 appeared	 to	 float	 at	 an	 infinite remove,	invisibly	buoyed	upon	the	bosom	of	a	fathomless	void	of	night.

Out	of	this	wind-swept	waste	of	impenetrable	darkness	was	to	come	the	answer

to	these	many	questions	that	perplexed	him—perhaps.	Something	at	least	would

come	to	influence	him;	or	else	Mrs.	Ilkington’s	promise	had	been	mere	 blague....

Then	what?

Afterwards	 he	 assured	 himself	 that	 his	 stupidity	 had	 been	 unparalleled

inconceivable.	 And	 indeed	 there	 seems	 to	 be	 some	 colour	 of	 excuse	 for	 this drastic	stricture,	self-inflicted	though	it	were.

Below	 him,	 on	 the	 main	 deck,	 a	 squad	 of	 deckhands	 superintended	 by	 a	 petty officer	was	rigging	out	the	companion-ladder.

Very	suddenly—it	seemed,	because	of	the	immense	quiet	that	for	all	its	teeming

life	 enveloped	 the	 ship	 upon	 the	 cessation	 of	 the	 engine’s	 song—the	 vessel hesitated	and	then	no	longer	moved.	From	forward	came	the	clank	of	chains	as

the	anchor	cables	were	paid	out.	Supple	to	wind	and	tide,	the	Autocratic	swung

in	 a	 wide	 arc,	 until	 the	 lights	 of	 the	 tender	 disappeared	 from	 Staff’s	 field	 of vision.

Before	 long,	 however,	 they	 swam	 silently	 again	 into	 sight;	 then	 slowly,

cautiously,	 by	 almost	 imperceptible	 stages	 the	 gap	 closed	 up	 until	 the	 tender ranged	alongside	and	made	fast	to	her	gigantic	sister.

Almost	at	once	the	incoming	passengers	began	to	mount	the	companion-ladder.

Staff	promptly	abandoned	his	place	at	the	rail	and	ran	down	to	the	main-deck.	As

he	approached	the	doorway	opening	adjacent	to	the	companion-ladder	he	heard	a

woman’s	 laugh	 out	 on	 the	 deck:	 a	 laugh	 which,	 once	 heard,	 was	 never	 to	 be forgotten:	clear,	sweet,	strong,	musical	as	a	peal	of	fairy	bells.

He	stopped	short;	and	so	did	his	breath	for	an	instant;	and	so,	he	fancied,	did	his heart.	This,	then,	was	what	Mrs.	Ilkington	had	hinted	at!	But	one	woman	in	all

the	world	could	laugh	like	that	...

Almost	at	once	she	appeared,	breaking	through	the	cluster	of	passengers	on	the

deck	 and	 into	 the	 lighted	 interior	 with	 a	 swinging,	 vigorous	 manner	 suggestive of	 intense	 vitality	 and	 strength.	 She	 paused,	 glancing	 back	 over	 her	 shoulder, waiting	 for	 somebody:	 a	 magnificent	 creature,	 splendidly	 handsome,

wonderfully	graceful,	beautiful	beyond	compare.

“Alison!”	Staff	breathed	hoarsely,	dumfounded.

Though	his	exclamation	could	by	no	means	have	carried	to	her	ears,	she	seemed

to	 be	 instantly	 sensitive	 to	 the	 vibrations	 of	 his	 emotion.	 She	 swung	 round, raking	 her	 surroundings	 with	 a	 bright,	 curious	 glance,	 and	 saw	 him.	 Her	 smile deepened	adorably,	her	eyes	brightened,	she	moved	impulsively	toward	him	with

outflung	hands.

“Why,”	she	cried—“Why,	Staff!	Such	a	surprise!”

Nothing	could	have	been	more	natural,	spontaneous	and	unaffected.	In	an	instant

his	 every	 doubt	 and	 misgiving	 was	 erased—blotted	 out	 and	 as	 if	 it	 had	 never been.	 He	 caught	 and	 held	 her	 hands,	 for	 the	 moment	 speechless.	 But	 his	 eyes were	 all	 too	 eloquent:	 under	 their	 steadfast	 sincerity	 her	 own	 gaze	 wavered, shifted	and	fell.	She	coloured	consummately,	then	with	a	gentle	but	determined

manner	disengaged	her	hands.

“Don’t,”	she	said	in	the	low,	intimate	voice	she	knew	so	well	how	and	when	to

employ—“don’t!	 People	 are	 looking	 ...”	 And	 then	 with	 a	 bewildering	 shift, resuming	her	former	spirit:	“Of	all	things	wonderful,	Staff—to	meet	you	here!”

She	was	acting—masking	with	her	admirable	art	some	emotion	secret	from	him.

He	 knew	 this—felt	 it	 intuitively,	 though	 he	 did	 not	 understand;	 and	 the knowledge	 affected	 him	 poignantly.	 What	 place	 had	 dissimulation	 in	 their

understanding?	Why	need	she	affect	what	she	did	not	feel—with	him?

Distressed,	bewildered,	he	met	evasion	with	native	straightforwardness.

“I’m	 stunned,”	 he	 told	 her,	 holding	 her	 eyes	 with	 a	 grave,	 direct	 gaze;	 “I’m afraid	I	don’t	understand....	How	does	this	happen?”

“Why,	of	course,”	she	said,	maintaining	her	artificial	elation—“I	infer—you’ve

finished	 the	 play	 and	 are	 hurrying	 home.	 So—we	 meet,	 dear	 boy.	 Isn’t	 it delightful?”

“But	you’re	here,	on	this	side—?”

“Oh,	just	a	flying	trip.	Max	wanted	me	to	see	Bisson’s	new	piece	at	the	Porte	St.

Martin.	 I	 decided	 to	 go	 at	 the	 last	 moment—caught	 the	 Mauretania	 on	 eight hours’	 notice—stayed	 only	 three	 days	 in	 Paris—booked	 back	 on	 this	 tub	 by telegraph—travelled	all	day	to	catch	it	by	this	wretched,	roundabout	route.	And

—and	there	you	are,	my	dear.”

She	 concluded	 with	 a	 gesture	 charmingly	 ingenuous	 and	 disarming;	 but	 Staff shook	his	head	impatiently.

“You	came	over—you	passed	through	London	twice—you	stayed	three	days	in

Paris,	Alison—and	never	let	me	know?”

“Obviously.”	She	lifted	her	shoulders	an	inch,	with	a	light	laugh.	“Haven’t	I	just said	as	much?...	You	see,	I	didn’t	want	to	disturb	you:	it	means	so	much	to—you

and	me,	Staff—the	play.”

Dissatisfied,	knitting	his	brows	faintly,	he	said:	“I	wonder	...!”

“My	dear!”	she	protested	gaily,	“you	positively	must	not	scowl	at	me	like	that!

You	 frighten	 me;	 and	 besides	 I’m	 tired	 to	 death—this	 wretched	 rush	 of

travelling!	 Tomorrow	 we’ll	 have	 a	 famous	 young	 pow-wow,	 but	 tonight—!	 Do

say	good	night	to	me,	prettily,	like	a	dear	good	boy,	and	let	me	go....	It’s	sweet	to see	 you	 again;	 I’m	 wild	 to	 hear	 about	 the	 play....	 Jane!”	 she	 called,	 looking round.

Her	maid,	a	tight-mouthed,	unlovely	creature,	moved	sedately	to	her	side.	“Yes,

Miss	Landis.”

“Have	my	things	come	up	yet?”	The	maid	responded	affirmatively.	“Good!	I’m

dead,	almost....”

She	 turned	 back	 to	 Staff,	 offering	 him	 her	 hand	 and	 with	 it,	 bewitchingly,	 her eyes:	“Dear	boy!	Good	night.”

He	 bent	 low	 over	 the	 hand	 to	 hide	 his	 dissatisfaction:	 he	 felt	 a	 bit	 old	 to	 be treated	like	a	petulant,	teasing	child....

“Good	night,”	he	said	stiffly.

“What	 a	 bear	 you	 are,	 Staff!	 Can’t	 you	 wait	 till	 tomorrow?	 At	 all	 events,	 you must....”

Laughing,	 she	 swept	 away,	 following	 her	 maid	 up	 the	 companion	 stairs.	 Staff pursued	 her	 with	 eyes	 frowning	 and	 perplexed,	 and	 more	 leisurely	 with	 his person.

As	 he	 turned	 aft	 on	 the	 upper	 deck,	 meaning	 to	 go	 to	 the	 smoking-room	 for	 a good-night	 cigarette—absorbed	 in	 thought	 and	 paying	 no	 attention	 to	 his

surroundings—a	 voice	 saluted	 him	 with	 a	 languid,	 exasperating	 drawl:	 “Ah, Staff!	How-d’-ye-do?”

He	looked	up,	recognising	a	distant	acquaintance:	a	man	of	medium	height	with

a	 tendency	 toward	 stoutness	 and	 a	 taste	 for	 extremes	 in	 the	 matter	 of	 clothes; with	dark,	keen	eyes	deep-set	in	a	face	somewhat	too	pale,	a	close-clipped	grey

moustache	and	a	high	and	narrow	forehead	too	frankly	betrayed	by	the	derby	he

wore	well	back	on	his	head.

Staff	 nodded	 none	 too	 cordially.	 “Oh,	 good	 evening,	 Arkroyd.	 Just	 come

aboard?”

Arkroyd,	on	the	point	of	entering	his	stateroom,	paused	long	enough	to	confirm

this	surmise.	“Beastly	trip—most	tiresome,”	he	added,	frankly	yawning.	“Don’t

know	 how	 I	 should	 have	 stood	 it	 if	 it	 hadn’t	 been	 for	 Miss	 Landis.	 You	 know

her,	I	believe?	Charming	girl—charming.”

“Oh,	quite,”	agreed	Staff.	“Good	night.”

His	tone	arrested	Arkroyd’s	attention;	the	man	turned	to	watch	his	back	as	Staff

shouldered	 down	 the	 alleyway	 toward	 the	 smoking-room.	 “I	 say!”	 commented

Mr.	 Arkroyd,	 privately.	 “A	 bit	 hipped—what?	 No	 necessity	 for	 being	 so	 bally short	with	a	chap....”

The	 guess	 was	 only	 too	 well	 founded:	 Staff	 was	 distinctly	 disgruntled.	 Within the	past	ten	minutes	his	susceptibilities	had	been	deeply	wounded.	Why	Alison

should	 have	 chosen	 to	 slight	 him	 so	 cavalierly	 when	 in	 transit	 through	 London passed	his	comprehension....	And	the	encounter	with	Arkroyd	comforted	him	to

no	degree	whatever.	He	had	never	liked	Arkroyd,	holding	him,	for	all	his	wealth,

little	better	than	a	theatre-loafer	of	the	Broadway	type;	and	now	he	remembered

hearing,	once	or	twice,	that	the	man’s	attentions	to	Alison	Landis	had	been	rather emphatic.

Swayed	 by	 whim,	 he	 chose	 to	 avoid	 the	 smoking-room,	 after	 all—having	 little wish	to	be	annoyed	by	the	chatter	of	Mr.	Iff—and	swung	out	on	deck	again	for	a

half-hour	of	cigarettes	and	lonely	brooding....

But	his	half-hour	lengthened	indefinitely	while	he	sat,	preoccupied,	in	the	deck-

chair	 of	 some	 total	 stranger.	 By	 definite	 stages,	 to	 which	 he	 was	 almost altogether	 oblivious,	 the	 Autocratic	 weighed	 anchor,	 shook	 off	 her	 tender	 and swung	 away	 on	 the	 seven-day	 stretch.	 As	 definitely	 her	 decks	 became	 bare	 of passengers.	Presently	Staff	was	quite	a	solitary	figure	in	the	long	array	of	chairs.

Two	bells	rang	mellowly	through	the	ship	before	he	roused,	lifted	himself	to	his

feet	and	prepared	to	turn	in,	still	distressed	and	wondering—so	much	so	that	he

was	barely	conscious	of	the	fact	that	one	of	the	officers	of	the	vessel	was	coming aft,	and	only	noticed	the	man	when	he	paused	and	spoke.

“I	say—this	is	Mr.	Staff,	isn’t	it?”

Staff	turned	quickly,	searching	his	memory	for	the	name	and	status	of	the	sturdy

and	good-looking	young	Englishman.

“Yes,”	he	said	slowly,	“but—”

“I’m	 Mr.	 Manvers,	 the	 purser.	 If	 I’m	 not	 mistaken,	 you	 crossed	 with	 us	 this spring?”

“Oh,	yes;	I	did.	How-d’-you-do?”	Staff	offered	his	hand.

“Sure	 I	 recognised	 you	 just	 now—saw	 you	 on	 the	 main-deck—talking	 to	 Miss Landis,	I	believe.”

“Yes	...?”

“Beg	pardon;	I	don’t	wish	to	seem	impertinent;	but	may	I	ask,	do	you	know	the

lady	very	well?”

Staff’s	eyes	clouded.	“Why	...”

“Knew	you’d	think	me	impertinent;	but	it	is	some	of	my	business,	really.	I	can

explain	 to	 your	 satisfaction.	 You	 see”—the	 purser	 stepped	 nearer	 and	 lowered his	voice	guardedly—“I	was	wondering	if	you	had	much	personal	influence	with

Miss	Landis.	I’ve	just	had	a	bit	of	a	chat	with	her,	and	she	won’t	listen	to	reason, you	know,	about	that	collar.”

“Collar?”	Staff	repeated	stupidly.

“The	 Cadogan	 collar,	 you	 know—some	 silly	 pearl	 necklace	 worth	 a	 king’s

ransom.	She	bought	it	in	Paris—Miss	Landis	did;	at	least,	so	the	report	runs;	and

she	 doesn’t	 deny	 it,	 as	 a	 matter	 of	 fact.	 Naturally	 that	 worries	 me;	 it’s	 a	 rather tempting	proposition	to	leave	lying	round	a	stateroom;	and	I	asked	her	just	now

to	let	me	take	care	of	it	for	her—put	it	in	my	safe,	you	know.	It’d	be	a	devilish

nasty	thing	for	the	ship,	to	have	it	stolen.”	The	purser	paused	for	effect.	“Would you	 believe	 it?	 She	 wouldn’t	 listen	 to	 me!	 Told	 me	 she	 was	 quite	 capable	 of taking	 care	 of	 her	 own	 property!	 Now	 if	 you	 know	 her	 well	 enough	 to	 say	 the right	word	...	it’d	be	a	weight	off	my	mind,	I	can	tell	you!”

“Yes,	 I	 can	 imagine	 so,”	 said	 Staff	 thoughtfully.	 “But—what	 makes	 you	 think there’s	any	possibility—”

“Well,	one	never	knows	what	sort	of	people	the	ship	carries—as	a	rule,	that	is.

But	 in	 this	 instance	 I’ve	 got	 good	 reason	 to	 believe	 there’s	 at	 least	 one	 man aboard	 who	 wouldn’t	 mind	 lifting	 that	 collar;	 and	 he’s	 keen	 enough	 to	 do	 it prettily,	too,	if	what	they	tell	of	him	is	true.”

“Now	you’re	getting	interesting.	Who	is	this	man?”

“Oh,	 quite	 the	 swell	 mobsman—Raffles	 and	 Arsène	 Lupin	 and	 all	 that	 sort	 of thing	rolled	into	one.	His	name’s	Ismay—Arbuthnot	Ismay.	Clever—wonderful,

they	say;	the	police	have	never	been	able	to	fasten	anything	on	him,	though	he’s been	known	to	boast	of	his	jobs	in	advance.”

“You	told	Miss	Landis	this?”

“Certainly—and	she	laughed.”

This	 seemed	 quite	 credible	 of	 the	 lady.	 Staff	 considered	 the	 situation	 seriously for	a	moment	or	two.

“I’ll	do	what	I	can,”	he	said	at	length;	“though	I’m	not	hopeful	of	making	her	see it	from	your	point	of	view.	Still,	I	will	speak	to	her.”

“That’s	good	of	you,	I’m	sure.	You	couldn’t	do	more.”

“You’re	positive	about	this	Ismay?”	Staff	pursued.	“You	couldn’t	be	mistaken?”

“Not	I,”	asserted	the	purser	confidently.	“He	crossed	with	us	last	year—the	time

Mrs.	 Burden	 Hamman’s	 jewels	 disappeared.	 Ismay,	 of	 course,	 was	 suspected, but	managed	to	prove	every	kind	of	an	alibi.”

“Queer	you	should	let	him	book	a	second	time,”	commented	Staff.

“Rather;	but	he’s	changed	his	name,	and	I	don’t	imagine	the	chaps	in	Cockspur

Street	know	him	by	sight.”

“What	name	does	he	travel	under	now?”

The	purser	smiled	softly	to	himself.	“I	fancy	you	won’t	be	pleased	to	learn	it,”

said	he.	“He’s	down	on	the	passenger-list	as	Iff—W.	H.	Iff.”





V

ISMAY?

When	 Staff	 went	 below	 a	 little	 later,	 he	 was	 somewhat	 surprised	 to	 find	 his stateroom	alight,—surprised,	because	he	had	rather	expected	that	Mr.	Iff	would

elect	to	sleep	off	his	potations	in	darkness.

To	 the	 contrary,	 the	 little	 man	 was	 very	 much	 awake,	 propped	 up	 in	 his	 berth with	 a	 book	 for	 company,	 and	 showed	 no	 effects	 whatever	 of	 overindulgence, unless	that	were	betrayed	by	a	slightly	enhanced	brightness	of	the	cool	blue	eyes

which	he	brought	to	bear	upon	his	roommate.

“Good	morning!”	he	piped	cheerfully.	“What	on	earth	got	you	up	so	early?	The

bar’s	been	closed	an	hour	and	more.”

“Is	that	why	you	came	to	bed?”	enquired	Staff.

“Sure,”	agreed	Mr.	Iff	complacently.

Staff	 quietly	 began	 to	 shed	 his	 clothing	 and	 to	 insert	 his	 spare	 frame	 into pajamas.	 Iff	 lay	 back	 and	 stared	 reflectively	 at	 the	 white-painted	 overhead girders.

“Got	 to	 slip	 it	 to	 you,”	 he	 observed	 presently,	 “for	 perfect	 mastery	 of	 the dignified	 reserve	 thing.	 I	 never	 knew	 anybody	 who	 could	 better	 control	 his tumultuous	emotions.”

“Thanks,”	said	Staff	drily	as	he	wound	up	his	watch.

“Anything	’special	troubling	you?”

“Why	do	you	ask?”

“You	talk	so	darn	much.”

“Sorry	if	I’m	keeping	you	awake,”	said	Staff	politely.

“Oh,	 I	 don’t	 mean	 to	 seem	 to	 beef	 about	 it,	 only	 ...	 I	 was	 wondering	 if	 by	 any chance	you’d	heard	the	news?”

“What	news?”

“About	me.”

“About	you!”	Staff	paused	with	his	fingers	on	the	light-switch.

“About	my	cute	little	self.	May	I	look	now?”	Iff	poked	his	head	over	the	edge	of

the	 upper	 berth	 and	 beamed	 down	 upon	 Staff	 like	 a	 benevolent,	 blond	 magpie.

“Haven’t	you	heard	the	rumour	that	I’m	a	desperate	character?”

“Just	what	do	you	mean?”	demanded	Staff,	eyeing	the	other	intently.

“Oh,	 simply	 that	 I	 overheard	 the	 purser	 discussing	 me	 with	 his	 assistant.	 He claims	 to	 recognise	 in	 me	 a	 bold	 bad	 man	 named	 Ismay,	 whose	 specialty	 is pulling	 off	 jobs	 that	 would	 make	 Sherlock	 Holmes	 ask	 to	 be	 retired	 on	 a pension.”

“Well?”

“Well	what?”

“Are	you	Ismay?”

A	 broad,	 mocking	 grin	 irradiated	 the	 little	 man’s	 pinched	 features.	 “Don’t	 ask me,”	he	begged:	“I	might	tell	you.”

Staff	 frowned	 and	 waited	 a	 minute,	 then,	 receiving	 no	 further	 response	 to	 his enquiry,	grunted	“Good	night,”	turned	off	the	light	and	got	into	his	berth.

A	 moment	 later	 the	 question	 came	 out	 of	 the	 darkness	 overhead:	 “I	 say—what do	 you	think?”

“Are	you	Iff	or	Ismay—you	mean?”

“Aye,	lad,	aye!”

“I	don’t	know.	It’s	for	you	to	say.”

“But	if	you	thought	I	was	Ismay	you’d	shift	quarters,	wouldn’t	you?”

“Why?”

“Because	I	might	pinch	something	of	yours.”

“In	 the	 first	 place,”	 said	 Staff,	 yawning,	 “I	 can’t	 shift	 without	 going	 into	 the

second	 cabin—and	 you	 know	 it:	 the	 boat’s	 full	 up.	 Secondly,	 I’ve	 nothing	 you could	steal	save	ideas,	and	you	haven’t	got	the	right	sort	of	brains	to	turn	them	to any	account.”

“That	ought	to	hold	me	for	some	time,”	Iff	admitted	fairly.	“But	I’m	concerned

about	 your	 sensitive	 young	 reputation.	 Suppose	 I	 were	 to	 turn	 a	 big	 trick	 this trip?”

“As	for	instance—?”

“Well,	say	I	swipe	the	Cadogan	collar.”

“Then	I’d	stand	just	so	much	the	better	chance	of	catching	you	red-handed.”

“Swell	 notion	 you’ve	 got	 of	 the	 cunning	 of	 the	 Twentieth	 Century	 criminal,	 I must	 say.	 D’	 you	 for	 an	 instant	 suppose	 my	 work’s	 so	 coarse	 that	 you	 could detect	grits	in	it?”

“Then	you	 are	Ismay?”

“My	 son,”	 said	 the	 other	 solemnly,	 “your	 pertinacity	 shan’t	 go	 unrewarded:	 I will	be	frank	with	you.	You	shall	know	all.	I	am	Iff—the	eternal	question.”

“Oh,	go	to	thunder!”	said	Staff	indignantly.

But	as	he	slipped	off	to	sleep	he	could	hear	the	man	overhead	chuckling	quietly,

beneath	his	breath....

The	next	few	days	would	have	provided	him	with	ample	opportunity	in	which	to

ponder	the	question	of	his	roommate’s	identity,	had	Staff	chosen	so	to	occupy	his

time.	 As	 it	 happened,	 Heaven	 was	 kind	 to	 the	 young	 man,	 and	 sent	 a	 gale	 of sorts,	which,	breaking	upon	the	Autocratic	the	following	morning,	buffeted	her

for	three	days	and	relegated	to	their	berths	all	the	poor	sailors	aboard,	including the	lady	with	the	pink	soul	and	underthings.	Of	Mrs.	Thataker,	indeed,	Staff	saw

nothing	 more	 until	 just	 before	 the	 vessel	 docked	 in	 New	 York.	 He	 wasn’t heartless	by	any	manner	of	means;	he	was,	as	a	matter	of	fact,	frankly	sorry	for

the	other	poor	passengers;	but	he	couldn’t	help	feeling	there	was	a	lot	of	truth	in the	old	saw	about	an	ill	wind....

Otherwise	 the	 bad	 weather	 proved	 annoying	 enough	 in	 several	 ways.	 To	 begin with,	 Alison	 Landis	 herself	 was	 anything	 but	 a	 good	 sailor,	 and	 even	 Miss Searle,	 though	 she	 missed	 no	 meals,	 didn’t	 pretend	 to	 enjoy	 the	 merciless

hammering	which	the	elements	were	administering	to	the	ship.	Alison	retired	to her	suite	immediately	after	the	first	breakfast	and	stuck	religiously	therein	until the	weather	moderated,	thus	affording	Staff	no	chance	to	talk	with	her	about	the

number	of	immediately	interesting	things	on	his	mind.	While	Miss	Searle	stayed

almost	 as	 steadily	 in	 her	 quarters,	 keeping	 out	 of	 harm’s	 way	 and	 reading,	 she told	 Staff	 when	 they	 met	 at	 meals.	 Mrs.	 Ilkington,	 of	 course,	 disappeared	 as promptly	as	Mrs.	Thataker.	In	consequence	of	all	of	which,	Staff	found	himself

thrown	 back	 for	 companionship	 on	 Bangs,	 who	 bored	 him	 to	 the	 point	 of

extinction,	 Arkroyd,	 whom	 he	 didn’t	 like,	 and	 Iff,	 who	 kept	 rather	 out	 of	 the way,	 dividing	 his	 time	 between	 his	 two	 passions	 and	 merely	 leering	 at	 the younger	 man,	 a	 leer	 of	 infinite	 cunning	 and	 derision,	 when	 chance	 threw	 them together.

In	despair	of	finding	any	good	excuse	for	wasting	his	time,	then,	Mr.	Staff	took

unto	 himself	 pens,	 ink,	 paper	 and	 fortitude	 and—surprised	 even	 himself	 by writing	that	fourth	act	and	finishing	his	play.	Again—an	ill	wind!

And	then,	as	if	bent	on	proving	its	integral	benevolence	so	far	as	concerned	Mr.

Staff,	 the	 wind	 shifted	 and	 sighed	 and	 died—beginning	 the	 operation	 toward sundown	of	the	third	day	out	from	Queenstown.	The	morning	of	the	fourth	day

dawned	clear	and	beautiful,	with	no	wind	worth	mentioning	and	only	a	moderate

sea	running—not	enough	to	make	much	of	an	impression	on	the	Autocratic.	So

pretty	 nearly	 everybody	 made	 public	 appearance	 at	 one	 time	 or	 another	 during the	morning,	and	compared	notes	about	their	historic	sufferings,	and	quoted	the

stewardess	who	had	been	heard	to	say	that	this	was	the	worst	westbound	passage

the	boat	had	ever	made,	and	regained	their	complexions,	and	took	notice	of	the

incipient	flirtations	and—well,	settled	down	in	the	usual	way	to	enjoy	an	ocean

voyage.

Staff,	of	course,	was	on	deck	betimes,	with	an	eye	eager	for	first	sight	of	Alison and	 another	 heedful	 of	 social	 entanglements	 which	 might	 prevent	 him	 from being	 first	 and	 foremost	 to	 her	 side	 when	 she	 did	 appear.	 But	 for	 all	 his watchfulness	and	care,	Mrs.	Ilkington	forestalled	him	and	had	Alison	in	convoy

before	 Staff	 discovered	 her;	 and	 then	 Arkroyd	 showed	 up	 and	 Mrs.	 Ilkington annexed	him,	and	Bangs	was	rounded	up	with	one	or	two	others	and	made	to	pay

court	 to	 Mrs.	 Ilkington’s	 newly	 snared	 celebrity	 and	 ...	 Staff	 went	 away	 and sulked	like	a	spoiled	child.	Nor	did	his	humour	become	more	cheerful	when	at

lunch	he	discovered	that	Mrs.	Ilkington	had	kept	two	seats	at	their	table	reserved for	Miss	Landis	and	Arkroyd.	It	had	been	a	prearranged	thing,	of	course;	it	had

been	 Alison	 with	 whom	 Mrs.	 Ilkington	 had	 talked	 about	 him	 in	 Paris;	 and

evidently	 Alison	 had	 been	 esquired	 by	 Arkroyd	 there.	 Staff	 didn’t	 relish	 the flavour	 of	 that	 thought.	 What	 right	 had	 Arkroyd	 to	 constitute	 himself	 Alison’s cavalier	on	her	travels?	For	that	matter,	what	right	had	Alison	to	accept	him	in

such	 a	 capacity?...	 Though,	 of	 course,	 Staff	 had	 to	 remind	 himself	 that	 Alison was	in	reality	not	bound	in	any	way....

But	he	had	his	reward	and	revenge	after	lunch.	As	the	party	left	the	table	Alison

dropped	 behind	 to	 speak	 to	 him;	 and	 in	 interchange	 of	 commonplaces	 they allowed	the	others	to	distance	them	beyond	earshot.

“You’re	a	dear,”	the	young	woman	told	him	in	a	discreet	tone	as	they	ascended

the	companionway.

“I’m	bound	to	say,”	he	told	her	with	a	faint,	expiring	flicker	of	resentment,	“that you	hardly	treat	me	like	one.”

Her	eyes	held	his	with	their	smiling	challenge,	half	provocative,	half	tender;	and she	 pouted	 a	 little,	 prettily.	 In	 this	 mood	 she	 was	 always	 quite	 irresistible	 to Staff.	 Almost	 against	 his	 will	 his	 dignity	 and	 his	 pose	 of	 the	 injured	 person evaporated	and	became	as	if	they	had	never	been.

“Just	the	same,”	she	declared,	laughing,	“you	are	a	dear—if	you	 don’t	deserve	to be	told	so.”

“What	have	I	done?”	he	demanded	guiltily—knowing	very	well	on	what	counts

he	was	liable	to	indictment.

“Oh,	nothing,”	said	Alison—“nothing	whatever.	You’ve	only	been	haughty	and

aloof	 and	 icy	 and	 indifferent	 and	 everything	 else	 that	 men	 seem	 to	 consider becoming	to	them	when	they	think	they’re	neglected.”

“You	certainly	don’t	expect	me	to	 like	seeing	Arkroyd	at	your	side	all	the	time?”

“Oh!”	 she	 laughed	 contemptuously—“Arkroyd!”	 And	 she	 dismissed	 that

gentleman	with	a	fine	sweeping	gesture.	“Can	I	help	it	if	he	happens	to	travel	on

the	same	ship?”

They	halted	at	the	top	of	the	steps.

“Then	it	was	accidental—?”	he	asked	seriously.

“Staff!”	 The	 young	 woman	 made	 an	 impatient	 movement.	 “If	 I	 didn’t	 like	 you

— you	know	how	much—upon	my	word	I’d	snub	you	for	that.	You	are	a	bear!”

“A	moment	ago	I	was	a	dear.”

“Oh,	well,	I’m	fond	of	all	sorts	of	animals.”

“Then	I	advise	your	future	husband	to	keep	you	away	from	zoos.”

“Oh,	Staff!	But	wouldn’t	you	want	me	to	come	to	see	you	once	in	a	while?”

He	jerked	up	one	hand	with	the	gesture	of	a	man	touched	in	a	fencing-bout.	“You

win,”	he	laughed.	“I	should’ve	known	better....”

But	 she	 made	 her	 regard	 tender	 consolation	 for	 his	 discomfiture.	 “You	 haven’t told	me	about	the	play—our	play— my	play?”

“It’s	finished.”

“Not	 really,	 Staff?”	 She	 clasped	 her	 hands	 in	 a	 charmingly	 impulsive	 way.	 He nodded,	smiling.	“Is	it	good?”

“You’ll	have	to	tell	me	that—you	and	Max.”

“Oh—Max!	He’s	got	to	like	what	I	like.	When	will	you	read	it	to	me?”

“Whenever	you	wish.”

“This	afternoon?”

“If	you	like.”

“Oh,	good!	Now	I’m	off	for	my	nap—only	I	know	I	shan’t	sleep,	I’m	so	excited.

Bring	the	’script	to	me	at	two—say,	half-past.	Come	to	my	sitting-room;	we	can

be	alone	and	quiet,	and	after	you’ve	finished	we	can	have	tea	together	and	talk

and—talk	our	silly	heads	off.	You	darling!”

She	gave	him	a	parting	glance	calculated	to	turn	any	man’s	head,	and	swung	off

to	her	rooms,	the	very	spirit	of	grace	incarnate	in	her	young	and	vigorous	body.

Staff	watched	her	with	a	kindling	eye,	then	shook	his	head	as	one	who	doubts—

as	 if	 doubting	 his	 own	 worthiness—and	 went	 off	 to	 his	 own	 stateroom	 to	 run over	 the	 type-script	 of	 his	 fourth	 act:	 being	 fortunate	 in	 having	 chosen	 a	 ship which	carried	a	typist,	together	with	almost	every	other	imaginable	convenience

and	alleged	luxury	of	life	ashore.

Punctual	to	the	minute,	manuscript	under	his	arm,	he	knocked	at	the	door	of	the

sitting-room	of	the	 suite	de	luxe	occupied	by	the	actress.	Her	maid	admitted	him and	 after	 a	 moment	 or	 two	 Alison	 herself	 came	 out	 of	 her	 stateroom,	 in	 a wonderful	 Parisian	 tea-gown	 cunningly	 designed	 to	 render	 her	 even	 more

bewilderingly	 bewitching	 than	 ever.	 Staff	 thought	 her	 so,	 beyond	 any	 question, and	as	unquestionably	was	his	thought	mirrored	in	his	eyes	as	he	rose	and	stood

waiting	for	her	greeting—very	nearly	a-tremble,	if	the	truth’s	to	be	told.

Her	colour	deepened	as	she	came	toward	him	and	then,	pausing	at	arm’s	length,

before	he	could	lift	a	hand,	stretched	forth	both	her	own	and	caught	him	by	the

shoulders.	 “My	 dear!”	 she	 said	 softly;	 and	 her	 eyes	 were	 bright	 and	 melting.

“My	 dear,	 dear	 boy!	 It’s	 so	 sweet	 to	 see	 you.”	 She	 came	 a	 step	 nearer,	 stood upon	her	tiptoes	and	lightly	touched	his	cheek	with	her	lips.

“Alison	...!”	he	cried	in	a	broken	voice.

But	 already	 she	 had	 released	 him	 and	 moved	 away,	 with	 a	 lithe	 and	 gracious movement	 evading	 his	 arms.	 “No,”	 she	 told	 him	 firmly,	 shaking	 her	 head:	 “no more	 than	 that,	 Staff.	 You	 mustn’t—I	 won’t	 have	 you—carry	 on	 as	 if	 we	 were children— yet.”

“But	Alison—”

“No.”	Again	she	shook	her	head.	“If	I	want	to	kiss	you,	I’ve	a	perfect	right	to;

but	that	doesn’t	give	you	any	licence	to	kiss	me	in	return.	Besides,	I’m	not	at	all sure	I’m	really	and	truly	in	love	with	you.	Now	do	sit	down.”

He	complied	sulkily.

“Are	you	in	the	habit	of	kissing	men	you	don’t	care	for?”

“Yes,	frequently,”	she	told	him,	coolly	taking	the	chair	opposite;	“I’m	an	actress

—if	you’ve	forgotten	the	fact.”

He	pondered	this,	frowning.	“I	don’t	like	it,”	he	announced	with	conviction.

“Neither	do	I—always.”	She	relished	his	exasperation	for	a	moment	longer,	then

changed	her	tone.	“Do	be	sensible,	Staff.	I’m	crazy	to	hear	that	play.	How	long

do	you	mean	to	keep	me	waiting?”

He	 knew	 her	 well	 enough	 to	 understand	 that	 her	 moods	 and	 whims	 must	 be humoured	 like	 a—well,	 like	 any	 other	 star’s.	 She	 was	 pertinaciously

temperamental:	that	is	to	say,	spoiled;	beautiful	women	are	so,	for	the	most	part

—invariably	so,	if	on	the	stage.	That	kind	of	temperament	is	part	of	an	actress’

equipment,	 an	 asset,	 as	 much	 an	 item	 of	 her	 stock	 in	 trade	 as	 any	 trick	 of elocution	or	pantomime.

So,	knowing	what	he	knew,	Staff	took	himself	in	hand	and	prepared	to	make	the

best	 of	 the	 situation.	 With	 a	 philosophic	 shrug	 and	 the	 wry,	 quaint	 smile	 so peculiarly	his	own,	he	stretched	forth	a	hand	to	take	up	his	manuscript;	but	in	the very	act,	remembering,	withheld	it.

“Oh,	I’d	forgotten	...”

“What,	my	dear?”	asked	Alison,	smiling	back	to	his	unsmiling	stare.

“What	 made	 you	 send	 me	 that	 bandbox?”	 he	 demanded	 without	 further

preliminary;	for	he	suspected	that	by	surprising	the	author	of	that	outrage,	and	by no	other	method,	would	he	arrive	at	the	truth.

But	though	he	watched	the	woman	intently,	he	was	able	to	detect	no	guilty	start,

no	 evidence	 of	 confusion.	 Her	 eyes	 were	 blank,	 and	 a	 little	 pucker	 of	 wonder showed	between	her	brows:	that	was	all.

“Bandbox?”	she	repeated	enquiringly.	“What	do	you	mean?”

“I	mean,”	he	pursued	with	a	purposeful,	omniscient	air,	“the	thing	you	bought	at

Lucille’s,	 the	 day	 before	 we	 sailed,	 and	 had	 sent	 me	 without	 a	 word	 of explanation.	What	did	you	do	it	for?”

Alison	 relaxed	 and	 sat	 back	 in	 her	 chair,	 laughing	 softly.	 “Dear	 boy,”	 she	 said

—“do	you	know?—you’re	quite	mad—quite!”

“Do	you	mean	to	say	you	didn’t—?”

“I	can’t	even	surmise	what	you’re	talking	about.”

“That’s	funny.”	He	pondered	this,	staring.	“I	made	sure	it	was	you.	Weren’t	you

in	London	last	Friday?”

“I?	Oh,	no.	Why,	didn’t	I	tell	you	I	only	left	Paris	Saturday	morning?	That’s	why

we	had	to	travel	all	day	to	catch	the	boat	at	Queenstown,	you	know.”

He	frowned.	“That’s	true;	you	did	say	so....	But	I	wish	I	could	imagine	what	it	all means.”

“Tell	me;	I’m	good	at	puzzles.”

So	he	recounted	the	story	of	the	bandbox	incognito,	Alison	lending	her	attention with	evident	interest,	some	animation	and	much	quiet	amusement.	But	when	he

had	finished,	she	shook	her	head.

“How	very	odd!”	she	said	wonderingly.	“And	you	have	no	idea—?”

“Not	 the	 least	 in	 the	 world,	 now	 that	 you’ve	 established	 an	 alibi.	 Miss	 Searle knows,	but—”

“What’s	that?”	demanded	Alison	quickly.

“I	say,	Miss	Searle	knows,	but	she	won’t	tell.”

“The	girl	who	sat	next	to	Bangs	at	lunch?”

“Yes—”

“But	how	is	that?	I	don’t	quite	understand.”

“Oh,	she	says	she	was	in	the	place	when	the	bandbox	was	purchased—saw	the

whole	 transaction;	 but	 it’s	 none	 of	 her	 affair,	 says	 she,	 so	 she	 won’t	 tell	 me anything.”

“Conscientious	young	woman,”	said	Alison	approvingly.	“But	are	you	quite	sure

you	 have	 exhausted	 every	 means	 of	 identifying	 the	 true	 culprit?	 Did	 you examine	the	box	yourself?	I	mean,	did	you	leave	it	all	to	the	housemaid—what’s

her	name—Milly?”

He	nodded:	“Yes.”

“Then	 she	 may	 have	 overlooked	 something.	 Why	 take	 her	 word	 for	 it?	 There may	be	a	card	or	something	there	now.”

Staff	looked	startled	and	chagrined.	“That’s	so.	It	never	occurred	to	me.	I	am	a

bonehead,	 and	 no	 mistake.	 I’ll	 just	 take	 a	 look,	 after	 we’ve	 run	 through	 this play.”

“Why	wait?	Send	for	it	now.	I’d	like	to	see	for	myself,	if	there	is	anything:	you

see,	you’ve	roused	a	woman’s	curiosity;	I	want	to	know.	Let	me	send	Jane.”

Without	waiting	for	his	consent,	Alison	summoned	the	maid.	“Jane,”	said	she,	“I

want	you	to	go	to	Mr.	Staff’s	stateroom—”

“Excuse	me,”	Staff	interrupted.	“Find	the	steward	named	Orde	and	ask	him	for the	bandbox	I	gave	him	to	take	care	of.	Then	bring	it	here,	please.”

“Yes,	sir,”	said	Jane;	and	forthwith	departed.

“And	now—while	we’re	waiting,”	suggested	Alison—“the	play,	if	you	please.”

“Not	 yet,”	 said	 Staff.	 “I’ve	 something	 else	 to	 talk	 about	 that	 I’d	 forgotten.

Manvers,	the	purser—”

“Good	 Heavens!”	 Alison	 interrupted	 in	 exasperation.	 She	 rose,	 with	 a	 general movement	of	extreme	annoyance.	“Am	I	never	to	hear	the	last	of	that	man?	He’s

been	after	me	every	day,	and	sometimes	twice	a	day....	He’s	a	personified	pest!”

“But	he’s	right,	you	know,”	said	Staff	quietly.

“Right!	Right	about	what?”

“In	wanting	you	to	let	him	take	care	of	that	necklace—the	what-you-may-call-it

thing—the	Cadogan	collar.”

“How	do	you	know	I	have	it?”

“You	admitted	as	much	to	Manvers,	and	Mrs.	Ilkington	says	you	have	it.”

“But	why	need	everybody	know	about	it?”

“Enquire	 of	 Mrs.	 Ilkington.	 If	 you	 wanted	 the	 matter	 kept	 secret,	 why	 in	 the sacred	 name	 of	 the	 great	 god	 Publicity	 did	 you	 confide	 in	 that	 queen	 of	 press agents?”

“She	had	no	right	to	say	anything—”

“Granted.	So	you	actually	have	got	that	collar	with	you?”

“Oh,	yes,”	Alison	admitted	indifferently,	“I	have	it.”

“In	this	room?”

“Of	course.”

“Then	be	advised	and	take	no	chances.”

Alison	had	been	pacing	to	and	fro,	impatiently.	Now	she	stopped,	looking	down

at	him	without	any	abatement	of	her	show	of	temper.

“You’re	 as	 bad	 as	 all	 the	 rest,”	 she	 complained.	 “I’m	 a	 woman	 grown,	 in	 full possession	 of	 my	 faculties.	 The	 collar	 is	 perfectly	 safe	 in	 my	 care.	 It’s	 here,	 in this	room,	securely	locked	up.”

“But	someone	might	break	in	while	you’re	out—”

“Either	Jane	is	here	all	the	time,	or	I	am.	It’s	never	left	to	itself	a	single	instant.

It’s	 perfectly	 ridiculous	 to	 suppose	 we’re	 going	 to	 let	 anybody	 rob	 us	 of	 it.

Besides,	 where	 would	 a	 thief	 go	 with	 it,	 if	 he	 did	 succeed	 in	 stealing	 it—

overboard?”

“I’m	willing	to	risk	a	small	bet	he’d	manage	to	hide	it	so	that	it	would	take	the

whole	ship’s	company,	and	a	heap	of	good	luck	into	the	bargain,	to	find	it.”

“Well,”	 said	 the	 woman	 defiantly,	 “I’m	 not	 afraid,	 and	 I’m	 not	 going	 to	 be browbeaten	by	any	scare-cat	purser	into	behaving	like	a	kiddie	afraid	of	the	dark.

I’m	 quite	 competent	 to	 look	 after	 my	 own	 property,	 and	 I	 purpose	 doing	 so without	anybody’s	supervision.	Now	let’s	have	that	understood,	Staff;	and	don’t

you	bother	me	any	more	about	this	matter.”

“Thanks,”	 said	 Staff	 drily;	 “I	 fancy	 you	 can	 count	 on	 me	 to	 know	 when	 I’m asked	to	mind	my	own	business.”

“Oh,	I	didn’t	mean	that—not	that	way,	dear	boy—but—”

At	this	juncture	the	maid	entered	with	the	bandbox,	and	Alison	broke	off	with	an

exclamation	of	diverted	interest.

“There!	 Let’s	 say	 no	 more	 about	 this	 tiresome	 jewel	 business.	 I’m	 sure	 this	 is going	to	prove	ever	so	much	more	amusing.	Open	it,	Jane,	please.”

In	another	moment	the	hat	was	in	her	hands	and	both	she	and	Jane	were	giving

passably	good	imitations—modified	by	their	respective	personalities—of	Milly’s

awe-smitten	admiration	of	the	thing.

Staff	 was	 conscious	 of	 a	 sensation	 of	 fatigue.	 Bending	 over,	 he	 drew	 the bandbox	 to	 him	 and	 began	 to	 examine	 the	 wrappings	 and	 wads	 of	 tissue-paper which	it	still	contained.

“It’s	a	perfect	dear!”	said	Miss	Landis	in	accents	of	the	utmost	sincerity.

“Indeed,	mum,”	chimed	Jane,	antiphonal.

“Whoever	your	anonymous	friend	may	be,	she	has	exquisite	taste.”

“Indeed,	mum,”	chanted	the	chorus.

“May	I	try	it	on,	Staff?”

“What?”	 said	 the	 young	 man	 absently,	 absorbed	 in	 his	 search.	 “Oh,	 yes;

certainly.	Help	yourself.”

Alison	moved	across	to	the	long	mirror	set	in	the	door	communicating	with	her

bedroom.	Here	she	paused,	carefully	adjusting	the	hat	to	her	shapely	head.

“Now,	sir!”	she	exclaimed,	turning.

Staff	sat	back	in	his	chair	and	looked	his	fill	of	admiration.	The	hat	might	have

been	 designed	 expressly	 for	 no	 other	 purpose	 than	 to	 set	 off	 this	 woman’s imperious	loveliness:	such	was	the	thought	eloquent	in	his	expression.

Satisfied	with	his	dumb	tribute,	Alison	lifted	off	the	hat	and	deposited	it	upon	a table.

“Find	anything?”	she	asked	lightly.

“Not	a	word,”	said	he—“not	a	sign	of	a	clue.”

“What	a	disappointment!”	she	sighed.	“I’m	wild	to	know....	Suppose,”	said	she,

posing	herself	before	him,—“suppose	the	owner	never	did	turn	up	after	all?”

“Hum,”	said	Staff,	perturbed	by	such	a	prospect.

“What	would	you	do	with	it?”

“Hum,”	said	he	a	second	time,	non-committal.

“You	 couldn’t	 wear	 it	 yourself;	 it’s	 hardly	 an	 ornament	 for	 a	 bachelor’s	 study.

What	 would	you	do	with	it?”

“I	 think,”	 said	 Staff,	 “I	 hear	 my	 cue	 to	 say:	 I’d	 give	 it	 to	 the	 most	 beautiful woman	alive,	of	course.”

“Thank	you,	dear,”	returned	Alison	serenely.	“Don’t	forget.”

She	 moved	 back	 to	 her	 chair,	 humming	 a	 little	 tune	 almost	 inaudibly;	 and	 in passing	lightly	brushed	his	forehead	with	her	hand—the	ghost	of	a	caress.

“You	may	go,	Jane,”	said	she,	sitting	down	to	face	her	lover;	and	when	the	maid had	 shut	 herself	 out	 of	 the	 room:	 “Now,	 dear,	 read	 me	 our	 play,”	 said	 Alison, composing	herself	to	attention.

Staff	took	up	his	manuscript	and	began	to	read	aloud....

Three	hours	elapsed	before	he	put	aside	the	fourth	act	and	turned	expectantly	to

Alison.

Elbow	 on	 knee	 and	 chin	 in	 hand,	 eyes	 fixed	 upon	 his	 face,	 she	 sat	 as	 one entranced,	 unable	 still	 to	 shake	 off	 the	 spell	 of	 his	 invention:	 more	 lovely,	 he thought,	 in	 this	 mood	 of	 thoughtfulness	 even	 than	 in	 her	 brightest	 animation....

Then	with	a	little	sigh	she	roused,	relaxed	her	pose,	and	sat	back,	faintly	smiling.

“Well?”	he	asked	diffidently.	“What	do	you	think?”

“It’s	 splendid,”	 she	 said	 with	 a	 soft,	 warm	 glow	 of	 enthusiasm—“simply

splendid.	It’s	coherent,	it	hangs	together	from	start	to	finish;	you’ve	got	little	to learn	about	construction,	my	dear.	And	my	part	is	magnificent:	never	have	I	had

such	a	chance	to	show	what	I	can	do	with	comedy.	I’m	delighted	beyond	words.

But	...”	She	sighed	again,	distrait.

“But—?”	he	repeated	anxiously.

“There	 are	 one	 or	 two	 minor	 things,”	 she	 said	 with	 shadowy	 regret,	 “that	 you will	 want	 to	 change,	 I	 think:	 nothing	 worth	 mentioning,	 nothing	 important enough	to	mar	the	wonderful	cleverness	of	it	all.”

“But	tell	me—?”

“Oh,	 it’s	 hardly	 worth	 talking	 about,	 dear	 boy.	 Only—there’s	 the	 ingenue	 rôle; you’ve	given	her	too	much	to	do;	she’s	on	the	stage	in	all	of	my	biggest	scenes,

and	has	business	enough	in	them	to	spoil	my	best	effects.	Of	course,	that	can	be

arranged.	And	then	the	leading	man’s	part—I	don’t	want	to	seem	hypercritical,

but	 he’s	 altogether	 too	 clever;	 you	 mustn’t	 let	 him	 overshadow	 the	 heroine	 the way	 he	 does;	 some	 of	 his	 business	 is	 plainly	 hers—I	 can	 see	 myself	 doing	 it infinitely	 better	 than	 any	 leading	 man	 we	 could	 afford	 to	 engage.	 And	 those witty	lines	you’ve	put	into	his	mouth—I	 must	have	them;	you	won’t	find	it	hard, I’m	sure,	to	twist	the	lines	a	bit,	so	that	they	come	from	the	heroine	rather	than the	hero....”

Staff	held	up	a	warning	hand,	and	laughed.

“Just	a	minute,	Alison,”	said	he.	“Remember	this	is	a	play,	not	a	background	for you.	 And	 with	 a	 play	 it’s	 much	 as	 with	 matrimony:	 if	 either	 turns	 out	 to	 be	 a monologue	it’s	bound	to	be	a	failure.”

Alison	 frowned	 slightly,	 then	 forced	 a	 laugh,	 and	 rose.	 “You	 authors	 are	 all alike,”	she	complained,	pouting;	“I	mean,	as	authors.	But	I’m	not	going	to	have

any	 trouble	 with	 you,	 dear	 boy.	 We’ll	 agree	 on	 everything;	 I’m	 going	 to	 be reasonable	 and	 you’ve	 got	 to	 be.	 Besides,	 we’ve	 heaps	 of	 time	 to	 talk	 it	 over.

Now	 I’m	 going	 to	 change	 and	 get	 up	 on	 deck.	 Will	 you	 wait	 for	 me	 in	 the saloon,	outside?	I	shan’t	be	ten	minutes.”

“Will	 I?”	 he	 laughed.	 “Your	 only	 trouble	 will	 be	 to	 keep	 me	 away	 from	 your door,	 this	 trip.”	 He	 gathered	 up	 his	 manuscript	 and	 steamer-cap,	 then	 with	 his hand	on	the	door-knob	paused.	“Oh,	I	forgot	that	blessed	bandbox!”

“Never	mind	that	now,”	said	Alison.	“I’ll	have	Jane	repack	it	and	take	it	back	to

your	steward.	Besides,	I’m	in	a	hurry,	stifling	for	fresh	air.	Just	give	me	twenty minutes....”

She	offered	him	a	hand,	and	he	bowed	his	lips	to	it;	then	quietly	let	himself	out

into	the	alleyway.





VI

IFF?

Late	 that	 night,	 Staff	 drifted	 into	 the	 smoking-room,	 which	 he	 found	 rather sparsely	 patronised.	 This	 fact	 surprised	 him	 no	 less	 than	 its	 explanation:	 it	 was after	eleven	o’clock.	He	had	hardly	realised	the	flight	of	time,	so	absorbed	had

he	been	all	evening	in	argument	with	Alison	Landis.

There	remained	in	the	smoking-room,	at	this	late	hour,	but	half	a	dozen	detached

men,	smoking	and	talking	over	their	nightcaps,	and	one	table	of	bridge	players—

in	whose	number,	of	course,	there	was	Mr.	Iff.

Nodding	 abstractedly	 to	 the	 little	 man,	 Staff	 found	 a	 quiet	 corner	 and	 sat	 him down	 with	 a	 sigh	 and	 a	 shake	 of	 his	 head	 that	 illustrated	 vividly	 his	 frame	 of mind.	He	was	a	little	blue	and	more	than	a	little	distressed.	And	this	was	nothing but	 natural,	 since	 he	 was	 still	 in	 the	 throes	 of	 the	 discovery	 that	 one	 man	 can hardly	 with	 success	 play	 the	 dual	 rôle	 of	 playwright	 and	 sweetheart	 to	 a successful	actress.

Alison	 was	 charming,	 he	 told	 himself,	 a	 woman	 incomparable,	 tenderly	 sweet and	desirable;	and	he	loved	her	beyond	expression.	But	...	his	play	was	also	more

than	a	slight	thing	in	his	life.	It	meant	a	good	deal	to	him;	he	had	worked	hard

and	put	the	best	that	was	in	him	into	its	making;	and	hard	as	the	work	had	been,

it	 had	 been	 a	 labour	 of	 love.	 He	 wasn’t	 a	 man	 to	 overestimate	 his	 ability;	 he possessed	a	singularly	sane	and	clear	appreciation	of	the	true	value	of	his	work,

harbouring	no	illusions	as	to	his	real	status	either	as	dramatist	or	novelist.	But	at the	 same	 time,	 he	 knew	 when	 he	 had	 done	 good	 work.	 And	 A	 Single	 Woman promised	to	be	a	good	play,	measured	by	modern	standards:	not	great,	but	sound

and	clear	and	strong.	The	plot	was	of	sufficient	originality	to	command	attention; the	 construction	 was	 clear,	 sane,	 inevitable;	 he	 had	 mixed	 the	 elements	 of comedy	and	drama	with	the	deftness	of	a	sure	hand;	and	he	had	carefully	built

up	 the	 characters	 in	 true	 proportion	 to	 one	 another	 and	 to	 their	 respective significance	in	the	action.

Should	all	this	then,	be	garbled	and	distorted	to	satisfy	a	woman’s	passion	for	the centre	of	the	stage?	Must	he	be	untrue	to	the	fundamentals	of	dramaturgic	art	in

order	 to	 earn	 her	 tolerance?	 Could	 he	 gain	 his	 own	 consent	 to	 present	 to	 the

public	 as	 work	 representative	 of	 his	 fancy	 the	 misshapen	 monstrosity	 which would	inevitably	result	of	yielding	to	Alison’s	insistence?

Small	wonder	that	he	sighed	and	wagged	a	doleful	head!

Now	while	all	this	was	passing	through	a	mind	wrapped	in	gloomy	and	profound

abstraction,	Iff’s	voice	disturbed	him.

“Pity	the	poor	playwright!”	it	said	in	accents	of	amusement.

Looking	 up,	 Staff	 discovered	 that	 the	 little	 man	 stood	 before	 him,	 a	 furtive twinkle	in	his	pale	blue	eyes.	The	bridge	game	had	broken	up,	and	they	two	were

now	 alone	 in	 the	 smoking-room—saving	 the	 presence	 of	 a	 steward	 yawning

sleepily	and	wishing	to	’Eaven	they’d	turn	in	and	give	’im	a	charnce	to	snatch	a

wink	o’	sleep.

“Hello,”	said	Staff,	none	too	cordially.	“What	d’	you	mean	by	that?”

“Hello,”	 responded	 Iff,	 dropping	 upon	 the	 cushioned	 seat	 beside	 him.	 He

snapped	his	fingers	at	the	steward.	“Give	it	a	name,”	said	he.

Staff	gave	it	a	name.	“You	don’t	answer	me,”	he	persisted.	“Why	pity	the	poor

playwright?”

“He	 has	 his	 troubles,”	 quoth	 Mr.	 Iff	 cheerfully,	 if	 vaguely.	 “Need	 I	 enumerate them,	 to	 you?	 Anyway,	 if	 the	 poor	 playwright	 isn’t	 to	 be	 pitied,	 what	 right	 ’ve you	got	to	stick	round	here	looking	like	that?”

“Oh!”	Staff	laughed	uneasily.	“I	was	thinking....”

“I	 flattered	 you	 to	 the	 extent	 of	 surmising	 as	 much.”	 Iff	 elevated	 one	 of	 the glasses	 which	 had	 just	 been	 put	 before	 them.	 “Chin-chin,”	 said	 he—“that	 is,	 if you’ve	 no	 particular	 objection	 to	 chin-chinning	 with	 a	 putative	 criminal	 of	 the d’p’st	dye?”

“None	whatever,”	returned	Staff,	lifting	his	own	glass—“at	least,	not	so	long	as

it	 affords	 me	 continued	 opportunity	 to	 watch	 him	 cooking	 up	 his	 cunning	 little crimes.”

“Ah!”	 cried	 Iff	 with	 enthusiasm—“there	 spoke	 the	 true	 spirit	 of	 Sociological Research.	Long	may	you	rave!”

He	set	down	an	empty	glass.

Staff	laughed,	sufficiently	diverted	to	forget	his	troubles	for	the	time	being.

“I	wish	I	could	make	you	out,”	he	said	slowly,	eyeing	the	older	man.

“You	mean	you	hope	I’m	not	going	to	take	you	in.”

“Either	way—or	both:	please	yourself.”

“Ah!”	said	the	little	man	appreciatively—“I	am	a	deep	one,	ain’t	I?”

He	laid	a	finger	alongside	his	nose	and	looked	unutterably	enigmatic.

At	this	point	they	were	interrupted:	a	man	burst	into	the	smoking-room	from	the

deck	and	pulled	up	breathing	heavily,	as	if	he	had	been	running,	while	he	raked

the	 room	 with	 quick,	 enquiring	 glances.	 Staff	 recognised	 Mr.	 Manvers,	 the purser,	 betraying	 every	 evidence	 of	 a	 disturbed	 mind.	 At	 the	 same	 moment, Manvers	caught	sight	of	the	pair	in	the	corner	and	made	for	them.

“Mr.	 Ismay—”	 he	 began,	 halting	 before	 their	 table	 and	 glaring	 gloomily	 at Staff’s	companion.

“I	beg	your	pardon,”	said	the	person	addressed,	icily;	“my	name	is	Iff.”

Manvers	made	an	impatient	movement	with	one	hand.	“Iff	or	Ismay—it’s	all	one

to	me—to	you	too,	I	fancy—”

“One	moment!”	snapped	Iff,	rising.	“If	you	were	an	older	man,”	he	said	stiffly,

“and	a	smaller,	I’d	pull	your	impertinent	nose,	sir!	As	things	stand,	I’d	probably get	my	head	punched	if	I	did.”

“That’s	sound	logic,”	returned	Manvers	with	a	sneer.

“Well,	then,	sir?	What	do	you	want	with	me?”

Manvers	changed	his	attitude	to	one	of	sardonic	civility.	“The	captain	sent	me	to

ask	you	if	you	would	be	kind	enough	to	step	up	to	his	cabin,”	he	said	stiltedly.

“May	I	hope	you	will	be	good	enough	to	humour	him?”

“Most	assuredly,”	Iff	picked	up	his	steamer-cap	and	set	it	jauntily	upon	his	head.

“Might	one	enquire	the	cause	of	all	this-here	fluster?”

“I	daresay	the	captain—”

“Oh,	very	well.	If	you	won’t	talk,	my	dear	purser,	I’ll	hazard	a	shrewd	guess—

by	your	leave.”

The	purser	stared.	“What’s	that?”

“I	 was	 about	 to	 say,”	 pursued	 Iff	 serenely,	 “that	 I’ll	 lay	 two	 to	 one	 that	 the Cadogan	collar	has	disappeared.”

Manvers	 continued	 to	 stare,	 his	 eyes	 blank	 with	 amazement.	 “You’ve	 got	 your nerve	with	you,	I	must	say,”	he	growled.

“Or	guilty	knowledge?	Which,	Mr.	Manvers?”

A	 reply	 seemed	 to	 tremble	 on	 Manvers’	 lips,	 but	 to	 be	 withheld	 at	 discretion.

“I’m	not	the	captain,”	he	said	after	a	slight	pause;	“go	and	cheek	him	as	far	as

you	like.	And	we’re	keeping	him	waiting,	if	I	may	be	permitted	to	mention	it.”

Iff	 turned	 to	 Staff,	 with	 an	 engaging	 smile.	 “Rejecting	 the	 guilty	 knowledge hypothesis,	 for	 the	 sake	 of	 the	 argument,”	 said	 he:	 “you’ll	 admit	 I’m	 the	 only suspicious	personage	known	to	be	aboard;	so	it’s	not	such	a	wild	guess—that	the

collar	 has	 vanished—when	 I’m	 sent	 for	 by	 the	 captain	 at	 this	 unearthly	 hour....

Lead	on,	Mr.	Manvers,”	he	wound	up	with	a	dramatic	gesture.

The	purser	nodded	and	turned	toward	the	door.	Staff	jumped	up	and	followed	the

pair.

“You	don’t	mind	my	coming?”	he	asked.

“No—wish	you	would;	you	can	bear	witness	to	the	captain	that	I	did	everything

in	my	power	to	make	Miss	Landis	appreciate	the	danger—”

“Then,”	 Iff	 interrupted	 suavely,	 “the	 collar	 has	 disappeared—we’re	 to

understand?”

“Yes,”	the	purser	assented	shortly.

They	 scurried	 forward	 and	 mounted	 the	 ladder	 to	 the	 boat-deck,	 where	 the captain’s	quarters	were	situated	in	the	deckhouse	immediately	abaft	the	bridge.

From	an	open	door—for	the	night	was	as	warm	as	it	was	dark—a	wide	stream	of

light	fell	athwart	the	deck,	like	gold	upon	black	velvet.

Pausing	 en	silhouette	against	the	glow,	the	purser	knocked	discreetly.	Iff	ranged up	beside	him,	dwarfed	by	comparison.	Staff	held	back	at	a	little	distance.

A	 voice	 from	 within	 barked:	 “Oh,	 come	 in!”	 Iff	 and	 Manvers	 obeyed.	 Staff

paused	on	the	threshold,	bending	his	head	to	escape	the	lintel.

Standing	 thus,	 he	 appreciated	 the	 tableau:	 the	 neat,	 tidy	 little	 room—

commodious	for	a	steamship—glistening	with	white-enamelled	woodwork	in	the

radiance	of	half	a	dozen	electric	bulbs;	Alison	in	a	steamer-coat	seated	on	the	far side	of	a	chart-table,	her	colouring	unusually	pallid,	her	brows	knitted	and	eyes

anxious;	 the	 maid,	 Jane,	 standing	 respectfully	 behind	 her	 mistress;	 Manvers	 to one	side	and	out	of	the	way,	but	plainly	eager	and	distraught;	Iff	in	the	centre	of the	 stage,	 his	 slight,	 round-shouldered	 figure	 lending	 him	 a	 deceptive	 effect	 of embarrassment	 which	 was	 only	 enhanced	 by	 his	 semi-placating,	 semi-wistful

smile	and	his	small,	blinking	eyes;	the	captain	looming	over	him,	authority	and

menace	 incarnate	 in	 his	 heavy,	 square-set,	 sturdy	 body	 and	 heavy-browed,

square-jawed,	beardless	and	weathered	face....

Manvers	said:	“This	is	Mr.	Iff,	Captain	Cobb.”

The	 captain	 nodded	 brusquely.	 His	 hands	 were	 in	 his	 coat-pockets;	 he	 didn’t offer	to	remove	them.	Iff	blinked	up	at	him	and	cocked	his	small	head	critically

to	one	side,	persistently	smiling.

“I’ve	heard	so	much	of	you,	sir,”	he	said	in	a	husky,	weary	voice,	very	subdued.

“It’s	a	real	pleasure	to	make	your	acquaintance.”

Captain	Cobb	noticed	this	bit	of	effrontery	by	nothing	more	than	a	growl	deep	in this	 throat.	 His	 eyes	 travelled	 on,	 above	 Iff’s	 head,	 and	 Staff	 was	 conscious	 of their	penetrating	and	unfriendly	question.	He	bowed	uncertainly.

“Oh—and	Mr.	Staff,”	said	Manvers	hastily.

“Well?”	said	the	captain	without	moving.

“A	friend	of	Miss	Landis	and	also—curiously—in	the	same	room	with	Mr.	Iff.”

“Ah,”	remarked	the	captain.	“How-d’-you-do?”	He	removed	his	right	hand	from

its	pocket	and	held	it	out	with	the	air	of	a	man	who	wishes	it	understood	that	by

such	action	he	commits	himself	to	nothing.

Before	 Staff	 could	 grasp	 it,	 Iff	 shook	 it	 heartily.	 “Ah,”	 he	 said	 blandly,	 “h’	 are ye?”	Then	he	dropped	the	hand,	thereby	preventing	the	captain	from	wrenching

it	away,	and	averted	his	eyes	modestly,	thereby	escaping	the	captain’s	outraged

glare.

Staff	 managed	 to	 overcome	 an	 impulse	 to	 laugh	 idiotically,	 and	 gravely	 shook hands	with	the	captain.	He	had	already	exchanged	a	glance	with	the	lady	of	his

heart’s	desire.

An	 insanely	 awkward	 pause	 marked	 Iff’s	 exhibition	 of	 matchless	 impudence.

Each	 hesitated	 to	 speak	 while	 the	 captain	 was	 occupied	 with	 a	 vain	 attempt	 to make	 Iff	 realise	 his	 position	 by	 scowling	 at	 him	 out	 of	 a	 blood-congested countenance.	 But	 of	 this,	 Iff	 appeared	 to	 be	 wholly	 unconscious.	 When	 the situation	 seemed	 all	 but	 unendurable	 for	 another	 second	 (Staff	 for	 one	 was haunted	 by	 the	 fear	 that	 he	 would	 throw	 back	 his	 head	 and	 bray	 like	 a	 mule) Manvers	 took	 it	 upon	 himself	 to	 ease	 the	 tension,	 hardily	 earning	 the	 undying gratitude	of	all	the	gathering.

“I	asked	Mr.	Staff	to	come	and	tell	you,	sir,”	he	said	haltingly,	“that	I	spoke	to him	about	this	matter	the	very	night	we	left	Queenstown—asked	him	to	do	what

he	could	to	make	Miss	Landis	appreciate—”

“I	see,”	the	captain	cut	him	short.

“That	 is	 so,”	 Staff	 affirmed.	 “Unfortunately	 I	 had	 no	 opportunity	 until	 this afternoon—”

Alison	interposed	quietly:	“I	am	quite	ready	to	exonerate	Mr.	Manvers	from	all

blame.	In	fact,	he	has	really	annoyed	me	with	his	efforts	to	induce	me	to	turn	the collar	over	to	his	care.”

“Thank	you,”	said	Manvers	bowing.

There	was	the	faintest	tinge	of	sarcasm	in	the	acknowledgment.	Staff	could	see

that	 Alison	 felt	 and	 resented	 it;	 and	 the	 thought	 popped	 into	 his	 mind,	 and immediately	out	again,	that	she	was	scarcely	proving	herself	generous.

“It’s	 a	 very	 serious	 matter,”	 announced	 the	 captain	 heavily—“serious	 for	 the service:	for	the	officers,	for	the	good	name	of	the	ship,	for	the	reputation	of	the company.	 This	 is	 the	 second	 time	 a	 crime	 of	 this	 nature	 had	 been	 committed aboard	the	Autocratic	within	a	period	of	eighteen	months—less	than	that,	in	fact.

It	was	June,	a	year	ago,	that	Mrs.	Burden	Hamman’s	jewels	were	stolen—on	the

eastbound	passage,	I	believe.”

“We	sailed	from	New	York,	June	22,”	affirmed	the	purser.

“I	 want,	 therefore,”	 continued	 the	 captain,	 “to	 ask	 you	 all	 to	 preserve	 silence about	 this	 affair	 until	 it	 has	 been	 thoroughly	 sifted.	 I	 believe	 the	 knowledge	 of the	theft	is	confined	to	those	present.”

“Quite	so,	sir,”	agreed	the	purser.

“May	I	ask	how	it	happened?”	Staff	put	in.

The	 captain	 swung	 on	 his	 heel	 and	 bowed	 to	 Alison.	 She	 bent	 forward,	 telling her	story	with	brevity	and	animation.

“You	remember”—she	looked	at	Staff—“when	we	met	in	the	saloon,	about	half-

past	five,	and	went	on	deck?...	Well,	right	after	that,	Jane	left	my	rooms	to	return the	hat	you	had	been	showing	me	to	your	steward.	She	was	gone	not	over	five

minutes,	and	she	swears	the	door	was	locked	all	the	time;	she	remembers	locking

it	 when	 she	 went	 out	 and	 unlocking	 it	 when	 she	 returned.	 There	 was	 no indication	 that	 anybody	 had	 been	 in	 the	 rooms,	 except	 one	 that	 we	 didn’t discover	 until	 I	 started	 to	 go	 to	 bed,	 a	 little	 while	 ago.	 Then	 I	 thought	 of	 my jewels.	They	were	all	kept	in	this	handbag”—she	dropped	a	hand	upon	a	rather

small	 Lawrence	 bag	 of	 tan	 leather	 on	 the	 table	 before	 her—“under	 my	 bed, behind	the	steamer	trunk.	I	told	Jane	to	see	if	it	was	all	right.	She	got	it	out,	and then	we	discovered	that	this	had	happened	to	it.”

She	turned	the	bag	so	that	the	other	side	was	presented	for	inspection,	disclosing

the	fact	that	some	sharp	instrument	had	been	used	to	cut	a	great	flap	out	of	the leather,	running	in	a	rough	semicircle	from	clasp	to	clasp	of	the	frame.

“It	 wasn’t	 altogether	 empty,”	 she	 declared	 with	 a	 trace	 of	 wonder	 in	 her	 voice;

“but	 that	 only	 makes	 it	 all	 the	 more	 mysterious.	 All	 my	 ordinary	 jewels	 were untouched;	nothing	had	been	taken	except	the	case	that	held	the	Cadogan	collar.”

“And	the	collar	itself,	I	hope?”	Iff	put	in	quietly.

The	actress	turned	upon	him	with	rising	colour.

“You	hope—!”	she	exclaimed.

The	little	man	made	a	deprecatory	gesture.	“Why,	yes,”	he	said.	“It	would	seem

a	 pity	 that	 a	 crook	 cute	 enough	 to	 turn	 a	 trick	 as	 neat	 as	 that	 should	 have	 got nothing	for	his	pains	but	a	velvet-lined	leather	case,	worth	perhaps	a	dollar	and	a half—or	say	two	dollars	at	the	outside,	if	you	make	a	point	of	 that.”

“How	do	you	happen	to	know	it	was	a	velvet-lined	leather	case?”	Alison	flashed.

Iff	laughed	quietly.	“My	dear	lady,”	he	said,	“I	priced	the	necklace	at	Cottier’s	in Paris	the	day	before	you	purchased	it.	Unfortunately	it	was	beyond	my	means.”

“A	bit	thick,”	commented	the	purser	in	an	acid	voice.

“Now,	listen”—Iff	turned	to	face	him	with	a	flush	of	choler—“you	keep	on	that

way	and	I’ll	land	on	you	if	it’s	the	last	act	of	my	gay	young	life.	You	hear	me?”

“That	will	do,	sir!”	barked	the	captain.

“I	trust	so,	sincerely,”	replied	Iff.

“Be	silent!”	The	captain’s	voice	ascended	a	full	octave.

“Oh,	 very	 well,	 very	 well.	 I	 hear	 you—perfectly.”	 With	 this	 the	 little	 man subsided,	smiling	feebly	at	vacancy.

Staff	interposed	hastily,	in	the	interests	of	peace:	“The	supposition	is,	then,	that the	thief	got	in	during	those	five	minutes	that	Jane	was	away	from	the	room?”

“It	couldn’t	have	happened	at	any	other	time,	of	course,”	said	Alison.

“And,	equally	of	course,	it	couldn’t	have	happened	then,”	said	Iff.

“Why	not?”	the	woman	demanded.

“The	girl	was	gone	only	five	minutes.	That’s	right,	isn’t	it?”

“Yes,	sir,”	said	Jane.

“And	the	door	was	locked—you’re	positive	about	that?”

“Quite,	sir.”

“Then	will	anyone	explain	how	any	thief	could	effect	an	entrance,	pull	a	heavy

steamer	trunk	out	from	under	a	bed,	get	at	the	bag,	cut	a	slit	in	its	side,	extract the	leather	case— and	the	collar,	to	be	sure—replace	the	bag,	replace	the	trunk, leave	the	stateroom	and	lock	the	door,	all	in	five	short	minutes—and	without	any

key?”	 Iff	 wound	 up	 triumphantly:	 “I	 tell	 you,	 it	 couldn’t	 be	 done;	 it	 ain’t human.”

“But	a	skeleton-key—”	Manvers	began.

“O	you!”	said	Iff	with	a	withering	glance.	“The	door	to	Miss	Landis’	suite	opens

directly	opposite	the	head	of	the	main	companionway,	which	is	in	constant	use—

people	going	up	and	down	all	the	time.	Can	you	see	anybody,	however	expert,

picking	 a	 lock	 with	 a	 bunch	 of	 skeleton-keys	 in	 that	 exposed	 position	 without being	caught	red-handed?	Not	on	your	vivid	imagination,	young	man.”

“There	may,	however,	be	duplicate	keys	to	the	staterooms,”	Alison	countered.

“My	dear	lady,”	said	Iff,	humbly,	“there	are;	and	unless	this	ship	differs	radically from	 others,	 those	 duplicate	 keys	 are	 all	 in	 the	 purser’s	 care.	 Am	 I	 right,	 Mr.

Manvers?”

“Yes,”	said	Manvers	sullenly.

“And	here’s	another	point,”	resumed	Iff.	“May	I	ask	you	a	question	or	two,	Miss

Landis?”	Alison	nodded	curtly.	“You	kept	the	handbag	locked,	I	presume?”

“Certainly.”

“And	when	you	found	it	had	been	tampered	with,	did	you	unlock	it?”

“There	wasn’t	any	need,”	said	Alison.	“You	can	see	for	yourself	the	opening	in

the	side	is	so	large—”

“Then	you	didn’t	unlock	it?”

“No.”

“That	only	makes	it	the	more	mysterious.	Because,	you	see,	it’s	unlocked	now.”

There	was	a	concerted	movement	of	astonishment.

“How	do	you	make	that	out,	sir?”	demanded	the	captain.

“You	can	see	for	yourself	(to	borrow	Miss	Landis’	phrase)	if	you’ll	only	use	your

eyes,	as	I	have.	The	side	clasps	are	in	place,	all	right,	but	the	slide	on	the	lock itself	is	pushed	a	trifle	to	the	left;	which	it	couldn’t	be	if	the	bag	were	locked.”

There	was	a	hint	of	derision	in	the	little	man’s	voice;	and	his	sarcastic	smile	was flickering	round	his	thin	lips	as	he	put	out	one	hand,	drew	the	bag	to	him,	lifted the	clasps,	and	pushing	back	the	lock-slide,	opened	it	wide.

“The	thot	plickens,”	he	observed	gravely.	“For	my	part	I	am	unable	to	imagine

any	bold	and	enterprising	crook	taking	the	trouble	to	cut	open	this	bag	when	the

most	casual	examination	would	have	shown	him	that	it	wasn’t	locked.”

“He	might	’ve	done	it	as	a	blind....”	Manvers	suggested.

“Officer!”	piped	Iff	in	a	plaintive	voice—“he’s	in	again.”

The	purser,	colouring	to	the	temples,	took	a	step	toward	the	little	man,	his	hands twitching,	 but	 at	 a	 gesture	 from	 the	 captain	 paused,	 controlled	 himself	 and	 fell back.

For	 a	 few	 moments	 there	 was	 quiet	 in	 the	 cabin,	 while	 those	 present	 digested Iff’s	conclusions	and	acknowledged	their	logic	irrefragable.	Staff	caught	Alison

staring	 at	 the	 man	 as	 if	 fascinated,	 with	 a	 curious,	 intense	 look	 in	 her	 eyes	 the significance	of	which	he	could	not	fathom.

Then	 the	 pause	 was	 brought	 to	 an	 end	 by	 the	 captain.	 He	 shifted	 his	 position abruptly,	so	that	he	towered	over	Iff,	scowling	down	upon	him.

“That	 will	 do,”	 he	 said	 ominously.	 “I’m	 tired	 of	 this;	 say	 what	 you	 will,	 you haven’t	hoodwinked	me,	and	you	shan’t.”

“My	 dear	 sir!”	 protested	 Iff	 in	 amazement.	 “Hoodwink	 you?	 Why,	 I’m	 merely trying	to	make	you	see—”

“You’ve	 succeeded	 in	 making	 me	 see	 one	 thing	 clearly:	 that	 you	 know	 more about	this	robbery	than	you’ve	any	right	to	know.”

“Oh,	 you-all	 make	 me	 tired,”	 complained	 Iff.	 “Now	 you	 have	 just	 heard	 Miss

Landis	 declare	 that	 this	 collar	 of	 pearls	 vanished	 between,	 say,	 five-thirty	 and five-forty-five.	Well,	I	can	prove	by	the	testimony	of	three	other	passengers,	and I	don’t	know	how	many	more,	to	say	nothing	of	your	smoke-room	stewards,	that

I	was	playing	bridge	from	four	until	after	six.”

“Ah,	 yes,”	 put	 in	 the	 purser	 sweetly,	 “but	 you	 yourself	 have	 just	 demonstrated conclusively	that	the	robbery	couldn’t	have	taken	place	at	the	hour	mentioned.”

Iff	grinned	appreciatively.	“You’re	improving,”	he	said.	“I	guess	that	doesn’t	get you	even	with	me	for	the	rest	of	your	life—what?”

“Moreover,”	 Manvers	 went	 on	 doggedly,	 “Ismay	 always	 could	 prove	 a	 copper-riveted	alibi.”

“That’s	one	of	the	best	little	things	he	does,”	admitted	Iff	cheerfully.

“You	 don’t	 deny	 you’re	 Ismay?”	 This	 from	 the	 captain,	 aggressive	 and

domineering.

“I	don’t	have	to,	dear	sir;	I	just	ain’t—that’s	the	answer.”

“You’ve	been	recognised,”	insisted	the	captain.	“You	were	on	this	ship	the	time

of	 the	 Burden	 Hamman	 robbery.	 Mr.	 Manvers	 knows	 you	 by	 sight;	 I,	 too,

recognise	you.”

“Sorry,”	murmured	Iff—“so	sorry,	but	you’re	wrong.	Case	of	mistaken	identity,	I give	you	my	word.”

“Your	word!”	snapped	the	captain	contemptuously.

“My	word,”	retorted	Iff	in	a	crisp	voice;	“and	more	than	that,	I	don’t	ask	you	to

take	it.	I’ve	proofs	of	my	identity	which	I	think	will	satisfy	even	you.”

“Produce	them.”

“In	 my	 own	 good	 time.”	 Iff	 put	 his	 back	 against	 the	 wall	 and	 lounged

negligently,	 surveying	 the	 circle	 of	 unfriendly	 faces	 with	 his	 odd,	 supercilious eyes,	 half	 veiled	 by	 their	 hairless	 lids.	 “Since	 you’ve	 done	 me	 the	 honour	 to impute	to	me	guilty	knowledge	of	this—ah—crime,	I	don’t	mind	admitting	that	I

was	a	passenger	on	the	Autocratic	when	Mrs.	Burden	Hamman	lost	her	jewels;

and	it	wasn’t	a	coincidence,	either.	I	was	with	you	for	a	purpose—to	look	out	for

those	 jewels.	 I	 shared	 a	 room	 with	 Ismay,	 and	 when,	 after	 the	 robbery,	 you mistook	me	for	him,	he	naturally	didn’t	object,	and	I	didn’t	because	it	left	me	all

the	 freer	 to	 prosecute	 my	 investigation.	 In	 fact,	 it	 was	 due	 to	 my	 efforts	 that Ismay	 found	 things	 getting	 too	 hot	 for	 him	 over	 in	 London	 and	 arranged	 to return	 the	 jewelry	 to	 Mrs.	 Hamman	 for	 an	 insignificant	 ransom—not	 a	 tithe	 of their	 value.	 But	 he	 was	 hard	 pressed;	 if	 he’d	 delayed	 another	 day,	 I’d	 ’ve	 had him	 with	 the	 goods	 on....	 That,”	 said	 Iff	 pensively,	 “was	 when	 I	 was	 in	 the Pinkerton	service.”

“Ah,	it	was?”	said	the	captain	with	much	irony.	“And	what,	pray,	do	you	claim	to

be	now?”

“Just	a	plain,	ordinary,	everyday	sleuth	in	the	employ	of	the	United	States	Secret Service,	 detailed	 to	 work	 with	 the	 Customs	 Office	 to	 prevent	 smuggling—the smuggling	of	such	articles	as,	say,	the	Cadogan	collar.”

In	 the	 silence	 that	 followed	 this	 astounding	 declaration,	 the	 little	 man	 hunched up	his	shoulders	until	they	seemed	more	round	than	ever,	and	again	subjected	the

faces	 of	 those	 surrounding	 him	 to	 the	 stare	 of	 his	 impertinent,	 pale	 eyes.	 Staff, more	detached	in	attitude	than	any	of	the	others	present,	for	his	own	amusement

followed	the	range	of	Iff’s	gaze.

Captain	 Cobb	 was	 scowling	 thoughtfully.	 Manvers	 wore	 a	 look	 of	 deepest

chagrin.	Jane’s	jaw	had	fallen	and	her	eyes	seemed	perilously	protrudant.	Alison

was	 leaning	 gracefully	 back	 in	 her	 chair—her	 pose	 studied	 but	 charmingly effective—while	 she	 favoured	 Iff	 with	 a	 scrutiny	 openly	 incredulous	 and

disdainful.

“You	 say	 you	 have	 proofs	 of	 this—ah—assertion	 of	 yours?”	 demanded	 the

captain	at	length.

“Oh,	 yes—surely	 yes.”	 Iff’s	 tone	 was	 almost	 apologetic.	 He	 thrust	 a	 hand between	his	shirt	and	waistcoat,	fumbled	a	moment	as	if	unbuttoning	a	pocket,

and	brought	forth	a	worn	leather	wallet	from	which,	with	great	and	exasperating

deliberation,	 he	 produced	 a	 folded	 paper.	 This	 he	 handed	 the	 captain—his manner,	if	possible,	more	than	ever	self-effacing	and	meek.

The	paper	(it	was	parchment)	crackled	crisply	in	the	captain’s	fingers.	He	spread

it	 out	 and	 held	 it	 to	 the	 light	 in	 such	 a	 position	 that	 Staff	 could	 see	 it	 over	 his shoulder.	He	was	unable	to	read	its	many	closely	inscribed	lines,	but	the	heading

“Treasury	 Department,	 Washington,	 D.	 C.”	 was	 boldly	 conspicuous,	 as	 well	 as an	imposing	official	seal	and	the	heavily	scrawled	signature	of	the	Secretary	of

the	Treasury.

Beneath	 the	 blue	 cloth,	 the	 captain’s	 shoulders	 moved	 impatiently.	 Staff	 heard him	say	something	indistinguishable,	but	of	an	intonation	calculated	to	express

his	emotion.

Iff	giggled	nervously:	“Oh,	captain!	the	ladies—”

Holding	 himself	 very	 stiff	 and	 erect,	 Captain	 Cobb	 refolded	 the	 document	 and ceremoniously	handed	it	back	to	the	little	man.

“I	beg	your	pardon,”	he	said	in	a	low	voice.

“Don’t	mention	it,”	begged	Iff.	He	replaced	the	paper	in	his	wallet,	the	wallet	in his	pocket.	“I’m	sure	it’s	quite	an	excusable	mistake	on	your	part,	captain	dear....

As	for	you,	Mr.	Manvers,	you	needn’t	apologise	to	me,”	he	added	maliciously:

“just	make	your	apologies	to	Captain	Cobb.”





VII

STOLE	AWAY!

And	 then	 (it	 seemed	 most	 astonishing!)	 nothing	 happened.	 The	 net	 outcome	 of all	 this	 fuss	 and	 fluster	 was	 precisely	 nil.	 With	 the	 collapse	 of	 the	 flimsy structure	of	prejudice	and	suspicion	in	which	Manvers	had	sought	to	trap	Iff,	the

interest	of	all	concerned	seemed	to	simmer	off	into	apathy.	Nobody	did	anything

helpful,	offered	any	useful	suggestion	or	brought	to	light	anything	illuminating.

Staff	couldn’t	understand	it,	for	the	life	of	him....

There	was,	to	be	sure,	a	deal	more	talk	in	the	captain’s	cabin—talk	in	which	the

purser	 took	 little	 or	 no	 part.	 As	 a	 matter	 of	 fact,	 Manvers	 kept	 far	 in	 the background	 and	 betrayed	 every	 indication	 of	 a	 desire	 to	 crawl	 under	 the	 table and	be	a	good	dog.	The	captain	had	his	say,	however,	and	in	the	end	(since	he

was	rather	emphatic	about	it)	his	way.

He	earnestly	desired	that	the	matter	should	be	kept	quiet;	it	would	do	no	good,

he	argued,	to	noise	it	about	amongst	the	passengers;	the	news	would	only	excite

them	 and	 possibly	 (in	 some	 obscure	 and	 undesignated	 fashion)	 impede	 official investigation.	He	would,	of	course,	spare	no	pains	to	fathom	the	mystery;	drastic

measures	would	be	taken	to	secure	the	detection	of	the	culprit	and	the	restitution of	 the	 necklace	 to	 its	 rightful	 owner.	 The	 ship	 would	 be	 minutely,	 if	 quietly, searched;	not	a	member	of	the	crew,	from	captain	to	stoker,	would	be	spared,	nor

any	 passenger	 against	 whom	 there	 might	 develop	 the	 least	 cause	 for	 suspicion.

Detectives	 would	 meet	 the	 ship	 at	 New	 York	 and	 co-operate	 with	 the	 customs officials	 in	 a	 most	 minute	 investigation	 of	 the	 passengers’	 effects.	 Everything possible	 would	 be	 done—trust	 the	 captain!	 In	 the	 meantime,	 he	 requested	 all present	to	regard	the	case	as	confidential.

Iff	 concurred,	 somewhat	 gravely,	 somewhat	 diffidently.	 He	 was	 disposed	 to make	 no	 secret	 of	 the	 fact	 that	 his	 presence	 on	 board	 was	 directly	 due	 to	 the missing	necklace.	He	had	been	set	to	watch	Miss	Landis,	to	see	that	she	didn’t

smuggle	the	thing	into	the	United	States.	He	hoped	she	wouldn’t	take	offense	of

this:	such	was	his	business;	he	had	received	his	orders	and	had	no	choice	but	to

obey	 them.	 (And,	 so	 far	 as	 was	 discernible,	 Miss	 Landis	 did	 not	 resent	 his espionage;	but	she	seemed	interested	and,	Staff	fancied,	considerably	diverted.)

Mr.	Iff	could	promise	Miss	Landis	that	he	would	leave	no	stone	unturned	in	his

private	inquiry;	and	his	work,	likewise,	would	be	considerably	facilitated	if	the affair	were	kept	quiet.	He	ventured	to	second	the	captain’s	motion.

Miss	 Landis	 offered	 no	 objection;	 Staff	 and	 Manvers	 volunteered	 to	 maintain discretion,	 Jane	 was	 sworn	 to	 it.	 Motion	 seconded	 and	 carried:	 the	 meeting adjourned	 sine	 die;	 the	 several	 parties	 thereto	 separated	 and	 went	 to	 their respective	quarters.

Staff	accompanied	Alison	as	far	as	her	stateroom,	but	didn’t	tarry	long	over	his

second	good-nights.	The	young	woman	seemed	excusably	tired	and	nervous	and

anxious	 to	 be	 alone—in	 no	 mood	 to	 discuss	 this	 overwhelming	 event.	 So	 Staff spared	her.

In	his	own	stateroom	he	found	Mr.	Iff	half-undressed,	sitting	on	the	transom	and

chuckling	noiselessly,	apparently	in	such	a	transport	of	amusement	that	he	didn’t

care	 whether	 he	 ever	 got	 to	 bed	 or	 not.	 Upon	 the	 entrance	 of	 his	 roommate, however,	he	dried	his	eyes	and	made	an	effort	to	contain	himself.

“You	seem	to	think	this	business	funny,”	suggested	Staff,	not	at	all	approvingly.

“I	do,”	laughed	the	little	man—“I	do,	indeed.	It’s	a	grand	young	joke—clutch	it

from	me,	my	friend.”

“In	what	respect,	particularly,	do	you	find	it	so	vastly	entertaining?”

“Oh	...	isn’t	that	ass	Manvers	enough?”

Further	than	this,	Mr.	Iff	declined	to	be	interviewed.	He	clambered	briskly	into

his	 berth	 and	 chuckled	 himself	 to	 sleep.	 Staff	 considered	 his	 behaviour	 highly annoying.

But	it	was	on	the	following	day—the	last	of	the	voyage—that	he	found	reason	to

consider	the	affair	astonishing	because	of	the	lack	of	interest	displayed	by	those personally	 involved.	 He	 made	 no	 doubt	 but	 that	 the	 captain	 was	 keeping	 his word	to	the	extent	of	conducting	a	secret	investigation,	though	no	signs	of	any

such	proceeding	appeared	on	the	surface	of	the	ship’s	life.	But	Alison	he	could

not	 understand;	 she	 seemed	 to	 have	 cast	 care	 to	 the	 winds.	 She	 appeared	 at breakfast	 in	 the	 gayest	 of	 spirits,	 spent	 the	 entire	 morning	 and	 most	 of	 the afternoon	 on	 deck,	 the	 centre	 of	 an	 animated	 group	 shepherded	 by	 the

indefatigable	Mrs.	Ilkington,	dressed	herself	radiantly	for	the	grand	final	dinner, flirted	with	the	assiduously	attentive	Arkroyd	until	she	had	reduced	Staff	to	the

last	 stages	 of	 corroded	 jealousy,	 and	 in	 general	 (as	 Staff	 found	 a	 chance	 to	 tell

her)	seemed	to	be	having	the	time	of	her	life.

“And	why	not?”	she	countered.	“Spilt	milk!”

“Judged	 by	 your	 conduct,”	 observed	 Staff,	 “one	 would	 be	 justified	 in	 thinking the	Cadogan	collar	an	 article	de	Paris.”

“One	might	think	any	number	of	foolish	things,	dear	boy.	If	the	collar’s	gone,	it’s gone,	and	not	all	the	moping	and	glooming	imaginable	will	bring	it	back	to	me.

If	 I	 do	 get	 it	 back—why,	 that’ll	 be	 simply	 good	 luck;	 and	 I’ve	 never	 found	 it profitable	yet	to	court	Fortune	with	a	doleful	mouth.”

“You	 certainly	 practise	 your	 theory,”	 he	 said.	 “I	 swear	 I	 believe	 I’m	 more concerned	about	your	loss	than	you	are.”

“Certainly	you	are,	you	silly	boy.	For	my	part,	I	feel	quite	confident	the	necklace will	be	returned.”

He	stared.	“Why?”

She	 opened	 her	 hands	 expressively.	 “I’ve	 always	 been	 lucky....	 Besides,	 if	 I never	 see	 it	 again,	 it’ll	 come	 back	 to	 me	 this	 way	 or	 that—in	 advertising,	 for one.”

“Isn’t	 that	 dodge	 pretty	 well	 worked	 out	 with	 the	 newspapers?	 It	 seems	 to	 me that	it	has	come	to	that,	of	late;	or	else	the	prime	donne	have	taken	to	guarding

their	valuables	with	greater	care.”

“Oh,	 that	 makes	 no	 difference.	 With	 another	 woman	 it	 might,	 but	 I”—she

shrugged—“I’m	 Alison	 Landis,	 if	 you	 please.	 The	 papers	 won’t	 neglect	 me.

Besides,	Max	can	do	much	as	he	likes	with	them.”

“Have	you—?”

“Of	course—by	wireless,	first	thing	this	morning.”

“But	you	promised—”

“Don’t	 be	 tiresome,	 Staff.	 I	 bought	 this	 necklace	 on	 Max’s	 suggestion,	 as	 an advertisement—I	 meant	 to	 wear	 it	 in	 A	 Single	 Woman;	 that	 alone	 would	 help make	our	play	a	go.	Since	I	can’t	get	my	advertising	and	have	my	necklace,	too,

why,	in	goodness’	name,	mayn’t	I	get	what	I	can	out	of	it?”

“Oh,	well	...”

Staff	abandoned	argument	and	resting	his	forearms	on	the	rail,	stared	sombrely out	over	the	darkling	waters	for	a	moment	or	two.

This	 was	 at	 night,	 during	 an	 intermission	 in	 a	 dance	 on	 deck	 which	 had	 been arranged	by	special	permission	of	the	weather—the	latter	holding	very	calm	and

warm.	Between	halves	Staff	had	succeeded	in	disentangling	Alison	from	a	circle

of	admirers	and	had	marched	her	up	to	the	boat-deck,	where	there	was	less	light

—aside	from	that	furnished	by	an	obliging	moon—and	more	solitude.

Under	 any	 other	 circumstances	 Staff	 would	 have	 been	 enchanted	 with	 the

situation.	They	were	quite	alone,	if	not	unobserved;	and	there	was	magic	in	the

night,	 mystery	 and	 romance	 in	 the	 moonlight,	 the	 inky	 shadows,	 the	 sense	 of swift	movement	through	space	illimitable.	Alison	stood	with	back	to	the	rail	so

near	 him	 that	 his	 elbow	 almost	 touched	 the	 artificial	 orchid	 that	 adorned	 her corsage.	He	was	acutely	sensitive	of	her	presence,	of	the	faint	persistent	odour	of her	individual	perfume,	of	the	beauty	and	grace	of	her	strong,	free-limbed	body

in	 its	 impeccable	 Paquin	 gown,	 of	 the	 sheen	 of	 her	 immaculate	 arms	 and shoulders	and	the	rich	warmth	of	her	face	with	its	alluring,	shadowed	eyes	that

seemed	 to	 mock	 him	 with	 light,	 fascinating	 malice,	 of	 the	 magnetism	 of	 her intense,	 ineluctable	 vitality	 diffused	 as	 naturally	 as	 sunlight.	 But—the	 thought rankled—Arkroyd	 had	 won	 three	 dances	 to	 his	 two;	 and	 through	 all	 that	 day Alison	 had	 seemed	 determined	 to	 avoid	 him,	 to	 keep	 herself	 surrounded	 by	 an obsequious	crowd,	impenetrable	to	her	lover....

On	 the	 deck	 below	 the	 band	 began	 to	 play	 again:	 signalling	 the	 end	 of	 the intermission.	 Alison	 hummed	 lightly	 a	 bit	 of	 the	 melody,	 her	 silken	 slipper tapping	the	deck.

“Do	I	get	another	dance?”	he	asked	suddenly.

She	 broke	 off	 her	 humming.	 “So	 sorry,”	 she	 said;	 “my	 card	 is	 quite	 full	 and running	over.”

“May	I	see	it?”	She	surrendered	it	without	hesitation.	He	frowned,	endeavouring

to	decipher	the	scrawl	by	the	inadequate	moonlight.

“You	wanted	to	know—?”	she	enquired,	with	a	laugh	back	of	her	tone.

“How	many	has	Arkroyd,	this	half?”	he	demanded	bluntly.

“Two,	I	think,”	she	answered	coolly.	“Why?”

He	 stared	 gravely	 into	 her	 shadowed	 face.	 “Is	 that	 good	 advertising,	 too,”	 he asked	 quietly—“to	 show	 marked	 preference	 to	 a	 man	 of	 Arkroyd’s	 calibre	 and reputation?”

Alison	laughed.	“You’re	delicious	when	you’re	jealous,	Staff,”	said	she.	“No;	it

isn’t	advertising—it’s	discipline.”

“Discipline?”

“Just	that.	I’m	punishing	you	for	your	obstinacy	about	the	play.	You’ll	see,	my

dear,”	 she	 taunted	 him:	 “I’m	 going	 to	 have	 my	 own	 way	 or	 make	 your	 life perfectly	miserable.”

Before	he	could	invent	an	adequate	retort,	the	beautiful	Mr.	Bangs	came	tripping

across	the	deck,	elation	in	his	manner.

“Ah,	 there	 you	 are,	 Miss	 Landis!	 My	 dance,	 you	 know.	 Been	 looking

everywhere	for	you.”

“So	sorry:	I	was	just	coming	down.”

Alison	 caught	 up	 the	 demi-train	 of	 her	 gown,	 but	 paused	 an	 instant	 longer, staring	Staff	full	in	the	face,	her	air	taunting	and	provocative.

“Think	 it	 over,	 Staff,”	 she	 advised	 in	 a	 cool,	 metallic	 voice;	 and	 dropping	 her hand	on	Bangs’	arm,	moved	languidly	away.

Staff	did	think	it	over,	if	with	surprisingly	little	satisfaction	to	himself.	It	wasn’t possible	to	ignore	the	patent	fact	that	Alison	had	determined	to	make	him	come

to	heel.	That	apparently	was	the	only	attitude	possible	for	one	who	aspired	to	the post	of	first	playwright-in-waiting	and	husband-in-ordinary	to	the	first	actress	in the	land.	He	doubted	his	ability	to	supple	his	back	to	the	requisite	degree.	Even

for	the	woman	he	loved....	Or	did	he?...	Through	the	wraith-like	mists	of	fading

illusions	he	caught	disturbing	glimpses—dark	shapes	of	lurking	doubts.

Disquieted,	he	found	distasteful	the	thought	of	returning	to	the	lower	deck,	and

so	strolled	idly	aft	with	a	half-formed	notion	of	looking	up	Iff.

From	a	deck-chair	a	woman’s	voice	hailed	him:	“Oh,	Mr.	Staff....”

“Miss	 Searle?”	 He	 turned	 in	 to	 her	 side,	 experiencing	 an	 odd	 sensation	 of pleasure	in	the	encounter;	which,	wisely	or	not,	he	didn’t	attempt	to	analyse—at

least	further	than	the	thought	that	he	had	seen	little	of	the	young	woman	during

the	last	two	days	and	that	she	was	rather	likeable.

“You’re	 not	 dancing?”	 he	 asked	 in	 surprise;	 for	 she,	 too,	 had	 dressed	 for	 this celebration	of	the	last	night	of	the	voyage.

Smiling,	she	shook	her	head	slightly.	“Neither	are	you,	apparently.	Won’t	you	sit

down?”

He	wasn’t	at	all	reluctant	to	take	the	chair	by	her	side.	“Why	not?”	he	asked.

“Oh,	I	did	dance	once	or	twice	and	then	I	began	to	feel	a	bit	tired	and	bored	and

stole	away	to	think.”

“Long,	long	thoughts?”	he	asked	lightly.

“Rather,”	 said	 she	 with	 becoming	 gravity.	 “You	 see,	 it	 seems	 pretty	 serious	 to one,	 this	 coming	 home	 to	 face	 new	 and	 unknown	 conditions	 after	 three	 years’

absence....	 And	 then,	 after	 six	 days	 at	 sea,	 out	 of	 touch	 with	 the	 world, practically,	there’s	always	the	feeling	of	suspense	about	what	will	happen	when

you	get	solid	earth	under	your	feet.	You	know	what	I	mean.”

“I	do.	You	live	in	New	York?”

“I	mean	to	try	to,”	she	said	quietly.	“I	haven’t	any	home,	really—no	parents	and

only	distant	family	connections.	In	fact,	all	I	do	possess	is	a	little	income	and	an immense	desire	to	work.”

“You’re	meaning	to	look	for	an	engagement,	then?”

“I	must.”

“Perhaps,”	 he	 said	 thoughtfully,	 “I	 might	 help	 you	 a	 bit;	 I	 know	 some	 of	 the managers	pretty	well	...”

“Thank	 you.	 I	 meant	 to	 ask	 you,	 but	 hoped	 you’d	 offer.”	 She	 laughed	 a	 trifle shyly.	 “I	 presume	 that’s	 a	 bold,	 forward	 confession	 to	 make,	 but	 I’ve	 been	 so long	abroad	I	don’t	know	my	way	round	at	home,	anymore.”

“That’s	 all	 right,”	 said	 Staff,	 liking	 her	 candour.	 “Where	 shall	 you	 be?	 Where can	I	find	you?”

“I	 hardly	 know—for	 a	 day	 or	 two	 at	 some	 hotel,	 and	 as	 soon	 as	 possible	 in	 a small	studio,	if	I	can	find	one	to	sublet.”

“Tell	you	what	you	do,”	he	suggested:	“drop	me	a	line	at	the	Players,	letting	me know	when	and	where	you	settle.”

“Thank	you,”	she	said,	“I	shall.”

He	was	silent	for	a	little,	musing,	his	gaze	wandering	far	over	the	placid	reaches of	the	night-wrapped	ocean.	“Funny	little	world,	this,”	he	said,	rousing:	“I	mean, the	ship.	Here	we	are	today,	some	several	hundreds	of	us,	all	knit	together	by	an

intricate	network	of	interests,	aims,	ambitions	and	affections	that	seem	as	strong and	inescapable	as	the	warp	and	woof	of	Life	itself;	and	yet	tomorrow—we	land,

we	separate	on	our	various	ways,	and	the	network	vanishes	like	a	dew-gemmed

spider’s	web	before	the	sun.”

“Only	 the	 dew	 vanishes,”	 she	 reminded	 him;	 “the	 web	 remains,	 if	 almost

invisible....	 Still,	 I	 know	 what	 you	 mean....	 Wasn’t	 that	 Miss	 Landis	 you	 were with,	just	now?”

“Yes.”

“Tell	 me”—she	 stirred,	 half	 turning	 to	 him—“has	 anything	 new	 transpired—

about	the	collar?”

“You	know	about	that!”	he	exclaimed	in	surprise.

“Of	course;	the	ship	has	been	humming	with	it	ever	since	dinner.”

“But	how—?”

“Mrs.	Ilkington	told	me,	of	course.	I	presume	Miss	Landis	told	her.”

“Doubtless,”	 he	 agreed	 reluctantly,	 little	 relishing	 the	 thought.	 Still,	 it	 seemed quite	plausible,	Alison’s	views	on	advertising	values	considered.	“No,”	he	added

presently;	“I’ve	heard	nothing	new.”

“Then	the	Secret	Service	man	hasn’t	accomplished	anything?”

“So	 you	 know	 about	 him,	 too?...	 Can’t	 say—haven’t	 seen	 him	 since	 morning.

Presumably	he’s	somewhere	about,	sniffing	for	clues.”

“Miss	Landis,”	said	the	girl	in	a	hesitant	manner—“doesn’t	seem	to	worry	very

much	...?”

“No,”	admitted	Staff.

“Either	that,	or	she’s	as	wonderful	an	actress	off	the	boards	as	on.”

“They	mostly	are,”	Staff	observed.	He	was	hardly	ready	to	criticise	his	beloved

to	a	comparative	stranger.	The	subject	languished	and	died	of	inanition.

“By	the	way—did	you	ever	solve	the	mystery	of	your	bandbox?”

Staff	started.	“What	made	you	think	of	that?”

“Oh—I	don’t	know.”

“No—haven’t	had	any	chance.	I	rather	expect	to	find	out	something	by	the	time	I

get	home,	though.	It	isn’t	likely	that	so	beautiful	a	hat	will	be	permitted	to	blush unseen.”	 His	 interest	 quickened.	 “Won’t	 you	 tell	 me,	 please?”	 he	 begged, bending	forward.

But	the	girl	laughed	softly	and	shook	her	head.

“Please!”

“Oh,	I	couldn’t.	I’ve	no	right	to	spoil	a	good	joke.”

“Then	you	think	it’s	a	joke?”	he	enquired	gloomily.

“What	else	could	it	be?”

“I	only	wish	I	knew!”

The	exclamation	was	so	fervent	that	Miss	Searle	laughed	again.

Six	bells	sounded	in	the	pause	that	followed	and	the	girl	sat	up	suddenly	with	a

little	cry	of	mock	dismay.

“Eleven	 o’clock!	 Good	 Heavens,	 I	 mustn’t	 loaf	 another	 minute!	 I’ve	 all	 my packing	to	do.”

She	 was	 up	 and	 standing	 before	 Staff	 could	 offer	 to	 assist	 her.	 But	 she	 paused long	enough	to	slip	a	hand	into	his.

“Good	night,	Mr.	Staff;	and	thank	you	for	volunteering	to	help	me.”

“I	shan’t	forget,”	he	promised.	“Good	night.”

He	 remained	 momentarily	 where	 she	 left	 him,	 following	 with	 his	 gaze	 her	 tall and	 slender	 yet	 well-proportioned	 figure	 as	 it	 moved	 along	 the	 moonlit	 deck,

swaying	gracefully	to	the	long,	smooth,	almost	imperceptible	motion	of	the	ship.

He	wore	just	then	a	curious	expression:	his	eyes	wondering,	his	brows	puckered,

his	thin	lips	shaping	into	their	queer,	twisted	smile....	Funny	(he	found	it)	that	a fellow	 could	 feel	 so	 comfortable	 and	 content	 in	 the	 company	 of	 a	 woman	 he didn’t	care	a	rap	about,	so	ill	at	ease	and	out	of	sorts	when	with	the	mistress	of his	dreams!	It	didn’t,	somehow,	seem	just	right....

With	a	dubious	grimace,	he	went	aft.	Iff,	however,	wasn’t	in	the	smoking-room.

Neither	was	he	anywhere	else	that	Staff	could	discover	in	his	somewhat	aimless

wanderings.	And	he	found	his	stateroom	unoccupied	when	at	length	he	decided

to	turn	in.

“Sleuthing,”	 was	 the	 word	 with	 which	 he	 accounted	 for	 the	 little	 man’s

invisibility,	as	he	dropped	off	to	sleep.

If	he	were	right,	Iff	was	early	on	the	job.	When	the	bath-steward’s	knock	brought

Staff	out	of	his	berth	the	next	morning,	his	companion	of	the	voyage	was	already

up	and	about;	his	empty	berth	showed	that	it	had	been	slept	in,	but	its	occupant

had	disappeared	with	his	clothing;	and	even	his	luggage	(he	travelled	light,	with

a	 kit-bag	 and	 a	 suit-case	 for	 all	 impedimenta)	 had	 been	 packed	 and	 strapped, ready	to	go	ashore.

“Conscientious,”	commented	the	playwright	privately.	“Wonder	if	he’s	really	on

the	track	of	anything?”

Idle	 speculation,	 however,	 was	 suddenly	 drowned	 in	 delight	 when,	 his	 sleep-numb	faculties	clearing,	he	realised	that	the	Autocratic	was	resting	without	way,

and	a	glance	out	of	the	stateroom	port	showed	him	the	steep	green	slopes	of	Fort

Tompkins	glistening	in	new	sunlight.

Home!	 He	 choked	 back	 a	 yell	 of	 joy,	 and	 raced	 to	 his	 bath.	 Within	 twenty minutes,	bathed,	clothed	and	sane,	he	was	on	deck.

By	 now,	 having	 taken	 on	 the	 health	 officers,	 the	 great	 vessel	 was	 in	 motion again,	 standing	 majestically	 up	 through	 the	 Narrows.	 To	 starboard,	 Bay	 Ridge basked	 in	 golden	 light.	 Forward,	 over	 the	 starboard	 bow,	 beyond	 leagues	 of stained	 water	 quick	 with	 the	 life	 of	 two-score	 types	 of	 harbour	 and	 seagoing craft,	New	York	reared	its	ragged	battlements	against	a	sky	whose	blue	had	been

faded	pale	by	summer	heat.	Soft	airs	and	warm	breathed	down	the	Bay,	bearing

to	his	nostrils	that	well-kenned,	unforgettable	odour,	like	none	other	on	earth,	of

the	sun-scorched	city.

Staff	 filled	 his	 lungs	 and	 was	 glad.	 It	 is	 good	 to	 be	 an	 American	 able	 to	 go roaming	 for	 to	 admire	 and	 for	 to	 see;	 but	 it	 is	 best	 of	 all	 to	 be	 an	 American coming	home.

Joy	 in	 his	 heart,	 Staff	 dodged	 below,	 made	 his	 customs	 declaration,	 bolted	 his breakfast	 (with	 the	 greater	 expedition	 since	 he	 had	 for	 company	 only	 Mrs.

Thataker,	 a	 plump,	 pale	 envelope	 for	 a	 soul	 of	 pink	 pining	 for	 sympathy)	 and hurried	back	to	the	deck.

Governor’s	 Island	 lay	 abeam.	 Beyond	 it	 the	 East	 River	 was	 opening	 up—

spanned	 by	 its	 gossamer	 webs	 of	 steel.	 Ahead,	 and	 near	 at	 hand,	 New	 York bulked	magnificently,	purple	canyons	yawning	between	its	pastel-tinted	cliffs	of

steel	and	glass	and	stone:	the	heat	haze,	dimming	all,	lent	soft	enchantment....

Ranks	of	staring	passengers	hid	the	rail,	each	a	bundle	of	unsuspected	hopes	and

fears,	longings	and	apprehensions,	keen	for	the	hour	of	landing	that	would	bring

confirmation,	denial,	disappointment,	fulfillment.

Amidships	 Staff	 descried	 Mrs.	 Ilkington’s	 head	 and	 shoulders	 next	 to	 Miss Searle’s	 profile.	 Arkroyd	 was	 with	 them	 and	 Bangs.	 Alison	 he	 did	 not	 see,	 nor Iff.	As	he	hesitated	whether	or	not	to	approach	them,	a	steward	touched	his	arm

apologetically.

“Beg	pardon—Mr.	Staff?”

“Yes	...?”

“Mr.	 Manvers—the	 purser,	 sir—awsked	 me	 to	 request	 you	 to	 be	 so	 kind	 as	 to step	down	to	Miss	Landis’	stiteroom.”

“Certainly.”

The	door	to	Alison’s	sitting-room	was	ajar.	He	knocked	and	heard	her	voice	bid

him	enter.	As	he	complied	it	was	the	purser	who	shut	the	door	tight	behind	him.

He	found	himself	in	the	presence	of	Alison,	Jane,	Manvers	and	three	men	whom

he	 did	 not	 know.	 Alison	 alone	 was	 seated,	 leaning	 back	 in	 an	 armchair,	 her expression	of	bored	annoyance	illustrated	by	the	quick,	steady	tapping	of	the	toe

of	her	polished	boot.	She	met	his	questioning	look	with	a	ready	if	artificial	and

meaningless	smile.

“Oh,	you	weren’t	far	away,	were	you,	Staff?”	she	said	lightly.	“These	gentlemen want	 to	 ask	 you	 some	 questions	 about	 that	 wretched	 necklace.	 I	 wish	 to goodness	I’d	never	bought	the	thing!”

Her	 expression	 had	 changed	 to	 petulance.	 Ceasing	 to	 speak,	 she	 resumed	 the nervous	drumming	of	her	foot	upon	the	carpet.

Manvers	 took	 the	 initiative:	 “Mr.	 Staff,	 this	 is	 Mr.	 Siddons	 of	 the	 customs service;	 this	 is	 Mr.	 Arnold	 of	 the	 United	 States	 Secret	 Service;	 and	 this,	 Mr.

Cramp	of	Pinkerton’s.	They	came	aboard	at	Quarantine.”

Staff	nodded	to	each	man	in	turn,	and	reviewed	their	faces,	finding	them	one	and

all	more	or	less	commonplace	and	uninteresting.

“How-d’-you-do?”	he	said	civilly;	and	to	Manvers:	“Well	...?”

“We	were	wondering	if	you’d	seen	anything	of	Mr.	Iff	this	morning?”

“No—nothing.	He	came	to	bed	after	I’d	gone	to	sleep	last	night,	and	was	up	and

out	before	I	woke.	Why?”

“He—”	the	purser	began;	but	the	man	he	had	called	Mr.	Arnold	interrupted.

“He	claimed	to	be	a	Secret	Service	man,	didn’t	he?”

“He	did,”	returned	Staff.	“Captain	Cobb	saw	his	credentials,	I	believe.”

“But	that	didn’t	satisfy	him,”	Manvers	put	in	eagerly.	“I	managed	to	make	him

understand	 that	 credentials	 could	 be	 forged,	 so	 he	 wirelessed	 for	 information.

And,”	the	purser	added	triumphantly	after	a	distinct	dramatic	pause,	“he	got	it.”

“You	mean	Iff	isn’t	what	he	claimed—?”	exclaimed	Staff.

Arnold	nodded	brusquely.	“There’s	no	such	person	in	the	service,”	he	affirmed.

“Then	he	 is	Ismay!”

The	Pinkerton	man	answered	him:	“If	he	is	and	I	lay	eyes	on	him,	I	can	tell	in

two	shakes.”

“By	George!”	cried	Staff	in	admiration—“the	clever	little	scamp!”

“You	 may	 well	 say	 so,”	 said	 Manvers	 bitterly.	 “If	 you’d	 listened	 to	 me—if	 the captain	had—this	wouldn’t	have	happened.”

“What—the	theft?”

“Yes,	that	primarily;	but	now,	you	know—because	he	was	given	so	much	rope—

he’s	vanished.”

“What!”

“Vanished—disappeared—gone!”	said	the	purser,	waving	his	hands	graphically.

“But	he	can’t	have	left	the	ship!”

“Doesn’t	 seem	 so,	 does	 it?”	 said	 the	 Pinkerton	 man	 morosely.	 “All	 the	 same, we’ve	made	a	pretty	thorough	search,	and	he	can’t	be	found.”

“You	 see,”	 resumed	 Manvers,	 “when	 the	 captain	 got	 word	 yesterday	 afternoon that	Iff	or	Ismay	wasn’t	what	he	pretended	to	be,	he	simply	wirelessed	back	for	a

detective,	 and	 didn’t	 arrest	 Iff,	 because—he	 said—he	 couldn’t	 get	 away.	 I	 told him	he	was	wrong—and	he	was!”





VIII

THE	WRONG	BOX

When	 the	 janitor	 and	 the	 taxicab	 operator	 between	 them	 had	 worried	 all	 his luggage	 upstairs,	 Staff	 paid	 and	 tipped	 them	 and	 thankfully	 saw	 the	 hall-door close	on	their	backs.	He	was	tired,	over-heated	and	glad	to	be	alone.

Shaking	off	his	coat,	he	made	a	round	of	his	rooms,	opening	windows.	Those	in

the	front	of	the	apartment	looked	out	from	the	second-story	elevation	upon	East

Thirtieth	 Street,	 between	 Fourth	 and	 Lexington	 Avenues.	 Those	 in	 the	 rear	 (he discovered	to	his	consummate	disgust)	commanded	an	excellent	view	of	a	very

deep	hole	in	the	ground	swarming	with	Italian	labourers	and	dotted	with	steam

drills,	mounds	of	broken	rock	and	carters	with	their	teams;	also	a	section	of	East Twenty-ninth	 Street	 was	 visible	 through	 the	 space	 that	 had	 been	 occupied	 no longer	ago	than	last	spring	by	a	dignified	row	of	brownstone	houses	with	well-tended	backyards.

Staff	cursed	soulfully	the	noise	and	dirt	caused	by	the	work	of	excavation,	shut

the	back	windows	to	keep	out	the	dust	and	returned	to	the	front	room—his	study,

library	and	reception-room	in	one.	With	the	addition	of	the	bath	off	the	bedroom

in	 the	 rear,	 and	 a	 large	 hall-closet	 opening	 from	 the	 study,	 these	 two	 rooms comprised	 his	 home.	 The	 hall	 was	 public,	 giving	 access	 to	 two	 upper	 floors which,	like	that	beneath	him,	were	given	up	to	bachelor	apartments.	The	house

was	in	reality	an	old-fashioned	residence,	remodelled	and	let	out	by	the	floor	to

young	men	mainly	of	Staff’s	ilk:	there	was	an	artist	on	the	upper	story,	a	writer

of	ephemeral	fiction	on	the	third,	an	architect	on	the	first.	The	janitor	infested	the basement,	 chiefly	 when	 bored	 by	 the	 monotony	 of	 holding	 up	 an	 imitation mahogany	 bar	 over	 on	 Third	 Avenue.	 His	 wife	 cooked	 abominably	 and	 served the	 results	 under	 the	 name	 of	 breakfast	 to	 the	 tenants,	 who	 foraged	 where	 they would	for	their	other	meals.	Otherwise	she	was	chiefly	distinguished	by	a	mad,

exasperating	 passion	 for	 keeping	 the	 rooms	 immaculately	 clean	 and	 in	 order.

Staff	 noted	 approvingly	 that,	 although	 Mrs.	 Shultz	 had	 not	 been	 warned	 of	 his return,	there	was	no	trace	of	dust	in	the	rooms,	not	a	single	stick	of	furniture	nor a	book	out	of	place.

There	 wasn’t	 really	 any	 reason	 why	 he	 should	 stick	 in	 such	 un-modern	 and inconveniently	situated	lodgings—that	is,	aside	from	his	ingrained	inclination	to

make	as	little	trouble	for	himself	as	possible.	To	hunt	a	new	place	to	live	would be	 quite	 as	 much	 of	 a	 nuisance	 as	 to	 move	 to	 it,	 when	 found.	 And	 he	 was comfortable	 enough	 where	 he	 was.	 He	 had	 taken	 the	 place	 some	 eight	 years previously,	at	a	time	when	it	was	rather	beyond	his	means;	today	when	he	could

well	 afford	 to	 live	 where	 he	 would	 in	 New	 York,	 he	 found	 that	 his	 rooms	 had become	a	habit	with	him.	He	had	no	intention	whatever	of	leaving	them	until	the

house	should	be	dismantled	to	make	way	for	some	more	modern	structure—like

that	going	up	in	the	rear—or	until	he	married.

He	poked	round,	renewing	acquaintance	with	old,	familiar	things,	unearthed	an

ancient	 pipe	 which	 had	 lain	 in	 one	 of	 his	 desk-drawers	 like	 a	 buried	 bone, fondled	 it	 lovingly,	 filled	 and	 lighted	 it,	 and	 felt	 all	 the	 time	 more	 and	 more content	and	at	ease.

Then	 Shultz	 knocked	 at	 the	 door	 and	 delivered	 to	 him	 a	 bundle	 of	 afternoon papers	for	which	he	had	filed	a	requisition	immediately	on	his	arrival.

He	sat	down,	enjoying	his	pipe	to	the	utmost	and	wondering	how	under	the	sun

he	 had	 managed	 to	 worry	 along	 without	 it	 all	 the	 time	 he	 had	 been	 away,	 and began	 to	 read	 what	 the	 reporters	 had	 to	 say	 about	 the	 arrival	 of	 the	 Autocratic and	the	case	of	the	Cadogan	collar.

In	 the	 main	 they	 afforded	 him	 little	 but	 amusement;	 the	 stories	 were	 mostly	 a hash	 of	 misinformation	 strongly	 flavoured	 with	 haphazard	 guesswork.	 The

salient	 facts	 of	 the	 almost	 simultaneous	 disappearance	 of	 the	 necklace	 and	 Mr.

Iff	stood	up	out	of	the	welter	of	surmise	like	mountain	peaks	above	cloud-rack.

There	were	no	other	facts.	And	both	these	remained	inexplicable.	No	trace	had

been	found	of	Mr.	Iff;	his	luggage	remained	upon	the	pier,	unclaimed.	With	him

the	Cadogan	collar	had	apparently	vanished	as	mysteriously:	thus	the	consensus.

The	 representative	 of	 the	 Secret	 Service	 bent	 on	 exposing	 an	 impostor,	 the Pinkerton	 men	 employed	 by	 the	 steamship	 company,	 and	 a	 gratuitous	 corps	 of city	 detectives	 were	 verbally	 depicted	 as	 so	 many	 determined	 bloodhounds

nosing	as	many	different	scents—otherwise	known	as	clues.

Jules	Max,	moreover,	after	a	conference	with	his	star,	had	published	an	offer	of	a reward	of	$10,000	for	the	return	of	the	necklace	or	for	information	leading	to	its recovery	whether	or	not	involving	the	apprehension	of	the	thief.

Several	 of	 the	 papers	 “ran”	 unusually	 long	 stories	 descriptive	 of	 the	 scenes	 on the	 pier.	 Staff	 chuckled	 over	 them.	 The	 necklace	 had,	 in	 fact,	 made	 no	 end	 of trouble	 for	 several	 hundred	 putatively	 innocent	 and	 guileless	 passengers.	 The

customs	examination	had	been	thorough	beyond	parallel.	Not	even	the	steerage and	 second-cabin	 passengers	 had	 escaped;	 everybody’s	 belongings	 had	 been

combed	 fine	 by	 a	 corps	 of	 inspectors	 whose	 dutiful	 curiosity	 had	 been

abnormally	 stimulated	 by	 the	 prospect	 of	 a	 ten-thousand-dollar	 reward.	 Not	 a few	passengers	had	been	obliged	to	submit	to	the	indignity	of	personal	search—

Staff	 and	 Alison	 in	 their	 number;	 the	 latter	 for	 no	 reason	 that	 Staff	 could imagine;	the	former	presumably	because	he	had	roomed	with	the	elusive	Mr.	Iff

on	 the	 way	 over.	 He	 had	 also	 been	 mulcted	 a	 neat	 little	 sum	 as	 duty	 on	 that miserable	hat,	which	he	had	been	obliged	to	declare	as	a	present	for	a	friend.

In	 memory	 of	 this	 he	 now	 rose,	 marched	 over	 to	 the	 bandbox,	 innocently reposing	in	the	middle	of	the	floor,	and	dispassionately	lifted	it	the	kick	he	had been	promising	it	ever	since	the	first	day	of	their	acquaintance.

It	sailed	up	prettily,	banged	the	wall	with	a	hollow	noise	and	dropped	to	the	floor with	a	grievous	dent	in	one	side.

There—out	 of	 his	 way—Staff	 left	 it.	 Immeasurably	 mollified,	 he	 proceeded	 to unpack	and	put	his	house	in	order.	By	the	time	this	was	done	to	his	satisfaction

and	Shultz	had	dragged	the	empty	trunks	into	the	hall,	to	be	carried	down-stairs

and	stored	in	the	cellar,	it	was	evening	and	time	to	dress.	So	Staff	made	himself

clean	 with	 much	 water	 and	 beautiful	 with	 cold	 steel	 and	 resplendent	 with evening	clothes,	and	tucked	the	manuscript	of	 A	Single	Woman	into	the	pocket	of a	light	topcoat	and	sallied	forth	to	dine	with	Jules	Max	and	Alison	Landis.

It	was	late,	something	after	midnight,	when	he	returned,	driving	up	to	his	house

in	 a	 taxicab	 and	 a	 decidedly	 disgruntled	 frame	 of	 mind.	 Alison	 had	 been especially	 trying	 with	 regard	 to	 the	 play;	 and	 Max,	 while	 privately	 letting	 the author	 see	 that	 he	 thought	 him	 in	 the	 right	 in	 refusing	 to	 make	 changes	 until rehearsals	 had	 demonstrated	 their	 advisability,	 and	 in	 spite	 of	 his	 voluble appreciation	 of	 the	 play’s	 merits,	 had	 given	 Alison	 the	 support	 she	 demanded.

The	 inference	 was	 plain:	 the	 star	 was	 to	 be	 humoured	 even	 at	 the	 cost	 of	 a crippled	 play.	 Between	 love	 for	 the	 woman	 and	 respect	 for	 his	 work,	 desire	 to please	her	and	determination	not	to	misrepresent	himself	to	the	public,	Staff,	torn this	 way	 and	 that,	 felt	 that	 he	 had	 at	 length	 learned	 the	 true	 meaning	 of	 “the horns	of	dilemma.”	But	this	reflection	availed	nothing	to	soothe	his	temper.

When	he	got	out	of	the	cab	a	short	but	sharp	argument	ensued	with	the	operator;

it	 seemed	 that	 “the	 clock”	 was	 out	 of	 order	 and	 not	 registering—had	 struck	 in conformance	to	the	time-honoured	custom	of	the	midnight	taximeter	union.	But

the	 driver’s	 habitual	 demand	 for	 two	 and	 one-half	 times	 the	 proper	 fare	 by distance	proved	in	this	instance	quite	fruitless.	Staff	calmly	counted	out	the	right amount,	 put	 it	 in	 the	 man’s	 hand,	 listened	 with	 critical	 appreciation	 to	 the resultant	 flow	 of	 profanity	 until	 it	 verged	 upon	 personality,	 then	 deliberately dragged	the	man	by	the	scruff	of	his	neck,	choking	and	cursing,	from	his	seat	to

the	sidewalk.

“Now,	 listen,”	 said	 he	 in	 a	 level	 tone:	 “you’ve	 got	 either	 to	 put	 up	 or	 shut	 up.

I’ve	been	sort	of	aching	to	beat	the	tar	out	of	one	of	you	highwaymen	for	some

time,	 and	 I	 feel	 just	 ripe	 for	 it	 tonight.	 You	 either	 put	 up	 your	 fists	 or	 crawl—

another	yap	out	of	you	and	I	won’t	wait	for	you	to	do	either.”

The	man	bristled	and	then,	analysing	the	gleam	in	Staff’s	eyes,	crawled:	that	is

to	say,	he	climbed	back	into	his	seat	and	swung	the	machine	to	the	far	side	of	the street	before	again	resorting	to	vituperation.

To	this	Staff	paid	no	more	attention.	He	was	opening	the	front	door.	The	passage

had	 comforted	 him	 considerably,	 but	 he	 was	 presently	 to	 regret	 it.	 But	 for	 that delay	he	might	have	been	spared	a	deal	of	trouble.

As	he	let	himself	into	the	house,	a	man	in	evening	dress	came	running	down	the

stairs,	 brushed	 past	 rudely	 and	 without	 apology,	 and	 slammed	 the	 door	 behind him.	 Staff	 wondered	 and	 frowned	 slightly.	 Presumably	 the	 fellow	 had	 been calling	 on	 one	 of	 the	 tenants	 of	 the	 upper	 floors.	 There	 had	 been	 something familiar	 in	 his	 manner—something	 reminiscent,	 but	 too	 indefinite	 for

recognition.	And	certainly	he’d	been	in	the	devil	of	a	hurry!

In	the	meantime	he	had	mounted	the	first	flight	of	stairs	and	turned	through	the

hall	to	his	study	door.	To	his	surprise	it	wasn’t	locked.	He	seemed	distinctly	to

remember	locking	it	when	he	had	left	for	dinner.	Still,	memory	does	play	us	odd

tricks.

He	 pushed	 the	 door	 open	 and	 entered	 the	 room.	 At	 the	 same	 moment	 he	 heard the	trilling	of	the	telephone	bell.	The	instrument	stood	upon	his	desk	between	the two	 front	 windows.	 Without	 pausing	 to	 switch	 on	 one	 of	 the	 lights	 in	 the combination	 gas-	 and	 electrolier	 in	 the	 centre	 of	 the	 room,	 he	 groped	 his	 way through	blinding	darkness	to	the	desk	and,	finding	the	telephone	instrument	with

the	certainty	of	old	acquaintance,	lifted	the	receiver	to	his	ear.

“Hello?”	he	called.

A	thin	and	business-like	voice	detailed	his	number.

“Yes,”	he	said.	“What	is	it?”

“Just	a	moment,”	came	out	of	the	night.	“Hold	the	wire.”

There	 was	 a	 pause	 in	 which	 it	 occurred	 to	 him	 that	 a	 little	 light	 would	 be	 a grateful	 thing.	 He	 groped	 for	 his	 desk-lamp,	 found	 it	 and	 scorched	 his	 fingers slightly	 on	 its	 metal	 reflector.	 He	 had	 switched	 on	 the	 light	 and	 said	 “Damn!”

mechanically	before	he	reflected	that	the	said	metal	reflector	had	no	right	to	be

hot	unless	the	light	had	been	burning	very	recently.

As	this	thought	penetrated	his	consciousness,	the	telephone	waxed	eloquent.

“Hello!”	called	a	voice.	“Is	that	you,	Staff?”

“Why!”	he	exclaimed	in	surprise—“yes,	Alison!”

“Are	you	alone?”

“Yes,”	he	said.	“What	is	it?”

“I	 just	 wanted	 to	 know,”	 returned	 the	 girl	 at	 the	 other	 end	 of	 the	 wire.	 “I’m coming	to	see	you.”

“What—now?”

“Of	course,	silly.”

“But	why—this	time	of	night—it	doesn’t	seem—”

“Oh,	I’ve	got	something	most	important	to	say	to	you—very	important	indeed.	It

won’t	keep.	I’ll	be	there	in	five	minutes.	Listen	for	the	taxi—will	you,	like	a	dear boy?—and	come	down	and	open	the	door	for	me.	Good-bye.”

“Good-bye,”	he	returned	automatically,	and	hung	up	the	receiver.

What	on	earth	could	 she	be	wanting,	that	could	have	turned	up	so	unexpectedly in	the	half-hour	since	he	had	left	her	and	that	wouldn’t	keep	till	morning?

Abruptly	he	became	aware	that	the	air	in	the	room	was	stiflingly	close.	And	he

had	left	the	windows	open	when	he	went	out;	he	knew	that	he	wasn’t	mistaken

about	that;	and	now	they	were	closed,	the	shades	drawn	tight!

This	considered	in	connection	with	the	open	door	that	had	been	locked,	and	the

heated	desk-lamp	that	 should	have	been	 cold,	he	couldn’t	 avoid	the	conclusion that	somebody	had	been	in	his	rooms,	an	unlawful	trespasser,	just	a	few	minutes

before	 he	 came	 in—possibly	 the	 very	 man	 who	 had	 rushed	 past	 him	 in	 such violent	haste	at	the	front	door.

He	jumped	up	and	turned	on	all	the	lights	in	the	room.	A	first,	hasty	glance	about showed	him	nothing	as	it	had	not	been	when	he	had	left	six	hours	or	so	ago—

aside	 from	 the	 front	 windows,	 of	 course.	 Mechanically,	 thinking	 hard	 and	 fast, he	went	to	these	latter	and	opened	them	wide.

The	possibility	that	the	intruder	might	still	be	in	the	rooms—in	his	bedroom,	for

instance—popped	into	his	head,	and	he	went	hurriedly	to	investigate.	But	there

wasn’t	anybody	in	the	back-room	or	the	bath-room.

Perplexed,	 he	 examined	 the	 rear	 windows.	 They	 were	 closed	 and	 locked,	 as when	he	had	left.	Opening	them,	he	peered	out	and	down	the	fire-escape;	he	had

always	 had	 a	 notion	 that	 anybody	 foolish	 enough	 to	 want	 to	 burgle	 his	 rooms would	find	it	easy	to	effect	an	entrance	via	the	fire-escape,	whose	bottom	rung

was	 only	 eight	 feet	 or	 so	 above	 the	 level	 of	 the	 backyard.	 And	 now,	 since	 the Twenty-ninth	 Street	 houses	 had	 been	 torn	 down,	 lending	 access	 easy	 via	 the excavation,	such	an	attempt	would	be	doubly	easy.

But	he	had	every	evidence	that	his	rooms	hadn’t	been	broken	into	by	any	such

route;	 although—of	 course!—an	 astute	 burglar	 might	 have	 thought	 to	 cover	 up his	tracks	by	relocking	the	windows	after	he	had	entered.	On	the	other	hand,	the

really	 wise	 marauder	 would	 have	 almost	 certainly	 left	 them	 open	 to	 provide	 a way	of	escape	in	emergency.

Baffled	and	wondering,	Staff	returned	to	his	study.	An	examination	of	the	hall-

closet	 yielded	 nothing	 illuminating.	 Everything	 was	 undisturbed,	 and	 there wasn’t	room	enough	therein	for	anybody	to	hide.

He	shut	the	closet	door	and	reviewed	the	study	more	carefully.	Not	a	thing	out	of

place;	even	that	wretched	bandbox	lay	where	he	had	kicked	it,	with	a	helpless,

abused	 look,	 the	 dented	 side	 turned	 pitifully	 to	 the	 light—much	 like	 a	 street beggar	exposing	a	maimed	limb	to	excite	public	sympathy.

He	struggled	to	think:	what	did	he	possess	worth	stealing?	Nothing	of	any	great

value:	 a	 modest	 collection	 of	 masculine	 jewelry—stick-pins	 and	 the	 like;	 a quantity	of	clothing;	a	few	fairly	good	pictures;	a	few	rare	books.	But	the	merest cursory	 examination	 showed	 that	 these	 were	 intact,	 one	 and	 all.	 What	 cash	 he

had	 was	 all	 upon	 his	 person.	 His	 desk,	 where	 the	 lamp	 had	 been	 lighted,	 held nothing	 valuable	 to	 anybody	 other	 than	 himself:	 manuscripts,	 account	 books, some	personal	papers	strictly	non-negotiable.	And	these	too	proved	undisturbed.

Swinging	 round	 from	 the	 desk,	 he	 rested	 his	 elbows	 on	 his	 knees,	 clasped	 his hands,	 and	 lapsed	 into	 the	 most	 profound	 of	 meditations;	 through	 which	 he arrived	at	the	most	amazing	discovery	of	all.

Very	 gradually	 his	 eyes,	 at	 first	 seeing	 not	 what	 they	 saw,	 focussed	 upon	 an object	 on	 the	 floor.	 Quite	 excusably	 he	 was	 reluctant	 to	 believe	 their	 evidence.

Eventually,	however,	he	bent	forward	and	picked	up	the	thing.

It	 lay	 in	 his	 hand,	 eloquently	 absurd—in	 his	 study!—a	 bow	 of	 violet-coloured velvet	 ribbon,	 cunningly	 knotted,	 complete	 in	 itself.	 From	 its	 reverse,	 a	 few broken	threads	of	silk	hung,	suggesting	that	it	had	been	originally	sewn	upon	a

gown,	or	some	other	article	of	dress,	from	which	it	had	been	violently	torn	away.

The	thing	was	 so	impossible—preposterous!—that	he	 sat	as	if	 stunned,	eyes	 a-

stare,	jaw	dropping,	wits	bemused;	until	abruptly	roused	by	the	sharp	barking	of

a	taxicab	horn	as	it	swung	round	the	corner	of	Fourth	Avenue	and	the	subsequent

grumble	of	its	motor	in	the	street	below.

Thrusting	the	velvet	knot	into	his	pocket	he	ran	down	and	opened	the	front	door

just	as	Alison	gained	the	top	of	the	brownstone	steps.

He	noticed	that	her	taxicab	was	waiting.

Still	 in	 her	 shimmering,	 silken,	 summery	 dinner-gown	 of	 the	 earlier	 evening,	 a light	chiffon	wrap	draped	round	her	shoulders,	she	entered	the	vestibule,	paused

and	stood	smiling	mischievously	into	his	grave,	enquiring	eyes.

“Surprised	you—eh,	Staff?”	she	laughed.

“Rather,”	 said	 he,	 bending	 over	 her	 hand	 and	 wondering	 at	 her	 high	 spirit	 of gaiety	so	sharply	in	contrast	with	her	determined	and	domineering	humour	of	a

few	hours	since.	“Why?”	he	asked,	shutting	the	outside	door.

“Just	wanted	to	see	you	alone	for	a	few	moments;	I’ve	something	to	say	to	you

—something	very	important	and	surprising....	But	not	down	here.”

“I	beg	your	pardon,”	he	said	contritely.	He	motioned	toward	the	stairs:	“There’s

no	elevator,	but	it’s	only	one	flight	up	...”

“No	 elevator!	 Heavens!”	 she	 cried	 in	 mock	 horror.	 “And	 this	 is	 how	 the	 other half	lives!”

She	caught	up	her	skirts	and	ran	up	the	stairs	with	footsteps	so	light	that	he	could hear	nothing	but	the	soft,	continuous	murmuring	of	her	silken	gown.

“Genius,”	 he	 said,	 ironic,	 as	 he	 followed	 her—“Genius	 frequently	 needs	 a	 lift but	is	more	often	to	be	found	in	an	apartment	without	one.	Permit	me”—he	flung

wide	the	door	to	his	study—“to	introduce	you	to	the	garret.”

“So	this	is	where	you	starve	and	write!”

Alison	 paused	 near	 the	 centre	 of	 the	 room,	 shrugging	 her	 wrap	 from	 her shoulders	and	dropping	it	carelessly	on	the	table.	He	saw	her	shoot	swift	glances

round	her	with	bright,	prying	eyes.

“I’m	afraid	I’m	not	enough	of	a	genius	to	starve,”	he	said;	“but	anyway,	here’s

where	I	write.”

“How	 interesting!”	 she	 drawled	 in	 a	 tone	 that	 conveyed	 to	 him	 the	 impression she	found	it	anything	but	that.	And	then,	a	trace	sharply:	“Please	shut	the	door.”

He	 lifted	 his	 brows	 in	 surprise,	 said	 “Oh?”	 and	 turning	 back	 did	 as	 bid.	 At	 the same	time	Alison	disposed	herself	negligently	in	a	capacious	wing-chair.

“Yes,”	she	took	up	his	monosyllable;	“it’s	quite	as	important	as	all	that.	I	don’t wish	 to	 be	 overheard.	 Besides,”	 she	 added	 with	 nonchalant	 irrelevance,	 “I	 do want	a	cigarette.”

Silently	 Staff	 found	 his	 metal	 cigarette-safe	 and	 offered	 it,	 put	 a	 match	 to	 the paper	roll	held	so	daintily	between	his	lady’s	lips,	and	then	helped	himself.

Through	 a	 thin	 veil	 of	 smoke	 she	 looked	 up	 into	 his	 serious	 face	 and	 smiled bewitchingly.

“Are	you	thrilled,	my	dear?”	she	asked	lightly.

“Thrilled?”	he	questioned.	“How?”

She	lifted	her	white,	gleaming	shoulders	with	an	air	of	half-tolerant	impatience.

“To	have	a	beautiful	woman	alone	with	you	in	your	rooms,	at	this	hour	o’	night

...	 Don’t	 you	 find	 it	 romantic,	 dear	 boy?	 Or	 aren’t	 you	 in	 a	 romantic	 mood tonight?	 Or	 perhaps	 I’m	 not	 sufficiently	 beautiful	 ...?”	 She	 ended	 with	 a

charming	little	petulant	moue.

“You	know	perfectly	well	you’re	one	of	the	most	beautiful	women	in	the	world,”

he	began	gravely;	but	she	caught	him	up.

“One	of—?”

“To	me,	of	course—you	know	the	rest:	the	usual	thing,”	he	said.	“But	you	didn’t

come	here	to	discuss	your	charms—now	did	you?”

She	 shook	 her	 head	 slightly,	 smiling	 with	 light-hearted	 malice.	 “By	 no	 means.

But,	at	the	same	time,	if	I’ve	a	whim	to	be	complimented,	I	do	think	you	might

be	gallant	enough	to	humour	me.”

But	he	was	in	anything	but	a	gallant	temper.	Mystery	hedged	his	thoughts	about

and	 possessed	 them;	 he	 couldn’t	 rid	 his	 imagination	 of	 the	 inexplicable

circumstances	 of	 the	 man	 who	 had	 broken	 into	 his	 rooms	 to	 steal	 nothing,	 and the	knot	of	velvet	ribbon	that	had	dropped	from	nowhere	to	his	study	floor.	And

when	he	forced	his	thoughts	back	to	Alison,	it	was	only	to	feel	again	the	smart	of some	of	the	stinging	things	she	had	chosen	to	say	to	him	that	night	during	their

discussion	 of	 his	 play,	 and	 to	 be	 conscious	 of	 a	 certain	 amount	 of	 irritation because	 of	 the	 effrontery	 of	 her	 present	 pose,	 assuming	 as	 it	 did	 that	 he	 would eventually	 bend	 to	 her	 will,	 endure	 all	 manner	 of	 insolence	 and	 indignity, because	he	hoped	she	would	marry	him.

Something	 of	 what	 was	 passing	 through	 his	 mind	 as	 he	 stood	 mute	 before	 her, she	read	in	his	look—or	intuitively	divined.

“Heavens!”	 she	 cried,	 “you’re	 as	 temperamental	 as	 a	 leading-man.	 Can’t	 you accept	 a	 word	 or	 two	 of	 criticism	 of	 your	 precious	 play	 without	 sulking	 like—

like	Max	does	when	I	make	up	my	mind	to	take	a	week’s	rest	in	the	middle	of

the	season?”

“Criticise	as	much	as	you	like,”	he	said;	“and	I’ll	listen	and	take	it	to	heart.	But	I don’t	 mind	 telling	 you	 I’m	 not	 going	 to	 twist	 this	 play	 out	 of	 all	 dramatic semblance	at	your	dictation—or	Max’s	either.”

For	 a	 moment	 their	 glances	 crossed	 like	 swords;	 he	 was	 conscious	 from	 the flicker	 in	 her	 eyes	 that	 her	 temper	 was	 straining	 at	 the	 leash;	 and	 his	 jaw assumed	 a	 certain	 look	 of	 grim	 solidity.	 But	 the	 outbreak	 he	 expected	 did	 not come;	Alison	was	an	artiste	too	consummate	not	to	be	able	to	control	and	mask

her	emotions—even	as	she	did	now	with	a	quick	curtaining	of	her	eyes	behind

long	lashes.

“Don’t	 let’s	 talk	 about	 that	 now,”	 she	 said	 in	 a	 soft,	 placating	 voice.	 “That’s	 a matter	 for	 hours	 of	 business.	 We’re	 getting	 farther	 and	 farther	 away	 from	 my errand.”

“By	all	means,”	he	returned	pleasantly,	“let	us	go	to	that	at	once.”

“You	 can’t	 guess?”	 She	 unmasked	 again	 the	 battery	 of	 her	 laughing	 eyes.	 He shook	his	head.	“I’ll	give	you	three	guesses.”

He	found	the	courage	to	say:	“You	didn’t	come	to	confess	that	I’m	in	the	right

about	the	play?”

She	pouted	prettily.	“Can’t	you	let	that	be?	No,	of	course	not.”

“Nor	to	bicker	about	it?”

She	laughed	a	denial.

“Nor	yet	to	conduct	a	guessing	contest?”

“No.”

“Then	I’ve	exhausted	my	allowance....	Well?”

“I	came,”	she	drawled,	“for	my	hat.”

“Your	hat?”	His	eyes	opened	wide.

She	 nodded.	 “My	 pretty	 hat.	 You	 remember	 you	 promised	 to	 give	 it	 to	 me	 if nobody	else	claimed	it.”

“Yes,	but	...”

“And	nobody	has	claimed	it?”

“No,	but	...”

“Then	I	want	my	hat.”

“But—hold	on—give	somebody	a	chance—”

“Stupid?”	she	laughed.	“Isn’t	it	enough	that	I	claim	it?	Am	I	nobody?”

“Wait	 half	 a	 minute.	 You’ve	 got	 me	 going.”	 He	 paused,	 frowning	 thoughtfully,

recollecting	his	wits;	then	by	degrees	the	light	began	to	dawn	upon	him.	“Do	you mean	you	really	did	send	me	that	confounded	bandbox?”

Coolly	she	inclined	her	head:	“I	did	just	that,	my	dear.”

“But	when	I	asked	you	the	same	question	on	the	Autocratic—”

“Quite	so:	I	denied	it.”

“And	you	were	in	London	that	Friday,	after	all?”

“I	was.	Had	to	be,	hadn’t	I,	in	order	to	buy	the	hat	and	have	it	sent	you?”

“But—how	did	you	know	I	was	sailing	Saturday?”

“I	happened	to	go	to	the	steamship	office	just	after	you	had	booked—saw	a	clerk

adding	your	name	to	the	passenger-list	on	the	bulletin-board.	That	gave	me	the

inspiration.	 I	 had	 already	 bought	 the	 hat,	 but	 I	 drove	 back	 to	 the	 shop	 and instructed	them	to	send	it	to	you.”

“But,	Alison!	to	what	end?”

“Well,”	 she	 said	 languidly,	 smiling	 with	 amusement	 at	 his	 bewilderment,	 “I thought	it	might	be	fun	to	hoodwink	you.”

“But—I	fail	to	see	the	joke.”

“And	will,	until	I	tell	you	All.”

Her	tone	supplied	the	capital	letter.

He	shrugged	helplessly.	“Proceed	...”

“Well,”	she	began	with	sublime	insouciance,	“you	see,	I’d	been	figuring	all	the

while	 on	 getting	 the	 necklace	 home	 duty-free.	 And	 I	 finally	 hit	 upon	 what seemed	a	rather	neat	little	plot.	The	hat	was	part	of	it;	I	bought	it	for	the	express purpose	 of	 smuggling	 the	 necklace	 in,	 concealed	 in	 its	 lining.	 Up	 to	 that	 point you	 weren’t	 involved.	 Then	 by	 happy	 accident	 I	 saw	 your	 name	 on	 the	 list.

Instantly	it	flashed	upon	me,	how	I	could	make	you	useful.	It	was	just	possible,

you	see,	that	those	hateful	customs	men	might	be	shrewd	enough	to	search	the

hat,	too.	How	much	better,	then,	to	make	you	bring	in	the	hat,	all	unsuspecting!

They’d	never	think	of	searching	it	in	your	hands!	You	see?”

His	face	had	been	hardening	during	this	amazing	speech.	When	she	stopped	he

shot	in	a	crisp	question:

“The	necklace	wasn’t	in	the	hat	when	delivered	to	me?	You	didn’t	trust	it	to	the

shop	people	over	night?”

“Of	 course	 not.	 I	 merely	 sent	 you	 the	 hat;	 then—as	 I	 knew	 you	 would—you mentioned	it	to	me	aboard	ship.	I	got	you	to	bring	it	to	my	room,	and	then	sent

you	out—you	remember?	While	you	waited	I	sewed	the	necklace	in	the	lining;	it

took	only	an	instant.	Then	Jane	carried	the	hat	back	to	your	steward.”

“So,”	he	commented	stupidly,	“it	wasn’t	stolen!”

“Naturally	not.”

“But	you	threw	suspicion	on	Iff—”

“I	daresay	he	was	guilty	enough	in	intent,	if	not	in	deed.	There’s	not	the	slightest doubt	in	my	mind	that	he’s	that	man	Ismay,	really,	and	that	he	shipped	with	us

for	the	especial	purpose	of	stealing	the	necklace	if	he	got	half	a	chance.”

“You	 may	 be	 right;	 I	 don’t	 know—and	 neither	 do	 you.	 But	 do	 you	 realise	 that you	came	near	causing	an	innocent	man	to	be	jailed	for	the	theft?”

“But	I	didn’t.	He	got	away.”

“But	 not	 Iff	 alone—there’s	 myself.	 Have	 you	 paused	 to	 consider	 what	 would have	happened	to	me	if	the	inspector	had	happened	to	find	that	necklace	in	the

hat?	 Heavens	 knows	 how	 he	 missed	 it!	 He	 was	 persistent	 enough!...	 But	 if	 he had	found	it,	I’d	have	been	jailed	for	theft.”

“Oh,	no,”	she	said	sweetly;	“I’d	never	have	let	it	go	that	far.”

“Not	even	if	to	confess	would	mean	that	you’d	be	sent	to	jail	for	smuggling?”

“They’d	never	do	that	to	a	woman....”

But	her	eyes	shifted	from	his	uneasily,	and	he	saw	her	colour	change	a	trifle.

“You	 know	 better	 than	 that.	 You	 read	 the	 papers—keep	 informed.	 You	 know what	happened	to	the	last	woman	who	tried	to	smuggle.	I	forgot	how	long	they

sent	her	up	for—five	months,	or	something	like	that.”

She	was	silent,	her	gaze	evasive.

“You	remember	that,	don’t	you?”

“Perhaps	I	do,”	she	admitted	unwillingly.

“And	you	don’t	pretend	you’d	’ve	faced	such	a	prospect	in	order	to	clear	me?”

Again	 she	 had	 no	 answer	 for	 him.	 He	 turned	 up	 the	 room	 to	 the	 windows	 and back	again.

“I	 didn’t	 think,”	 he	 said	 slowly,	 stopping	 before	 her—“I	 couldn’t	 have	 thought you	could	be	so	heartless,	so	self-centred	...!”

She	rose	suddenly	and	put	a	pleading	hand	upon	his	arm,	standing	very	near	him

in	all	her	loveliness.

“Say	thoughtless,	Staff,”	she	said	quietly;	“I	didn’t	mean	it.”

“That’s	hard	to	credit,”	he	replied	steadily,	“when	I’m	haunted	by	the	memory	of

the	lies	you	told	me—to	save	yourself	a	few	dollars	honestly	due	the	country	that

has	made	you	a	rich	woman—to	gain	for	yourself	a	few	paltry	columns	of	cheap,

sensational	 newspaper	 advertising.	 For	 that	 you	 lied	 to	 me	 and	 put	 me	 in jeopardy	of	Sing-Sing	...	me,	the	man	you	pretend	to	care	for—”

“Hold	on,	Staff!”	the	woman	interrupted	harshly.

He	moved	away.	Her	arm	dropped	back	to	her	side.	She	eyed	him	a	moment	with

eyes	hard	and	unfriendly.

“You’ve	said	about	enough,”	she	continued.

“You’re	not	prepared	to	deny	that	you	had	these	possibilities	in	mind	when	you

lied	to	me	and	made	me	your	dupe	and	cat’s-paw?”

“I’m	not	prepared	to	argue	the	matter	with	you,”	she	flung	back	at	him,	“nor	to

hold	myself	answerable	to	you	for	any	thing	I	may	choose	to	say	or	do.”

He	bowed	ceremoniously.

“I	think	that’s	all,”	he	said	pleasantly.

“It	is,”	she	agreed	curtly;	then	in	a	lighter	tone	she	added:	“There	remains	for	me only	to	take	my	blue	dishes	and	go	home.”

As	she	spoke	she	moved	over	to	the	corner	where	the	bandbox	lay	ingloriously

on	 its	 undamaged	 side.	 As	 she	 bent	 over	 it,	 Staff	 abstractedly	 took	 and	 lighted another	cigarette.

“What	made	you	undo	it?”	he	heard	the	woman	ask.

He	swung	round	in	surprise.	“I?	I	haven’t	touched	the	thing	since	it	was	brought

in—beyond	kicking	it	out	of	the	way.”

“The	 string’s	 off—it’s	 been	 opened!”	 Alison’s	 voice	 was	 trembling	 with

excitement.	She	straightened	up,	holding	the	box	in	both	hands,	and	came	hastily

over	to	the	table	beside	which	he	was	standing.	“You	see?”	she	said	breathlessly,

putting	it	down.

“The	string	was	on	it	when	I	saw	it	last,”	he	told	her	blankly....

Then	the	memory	recurred	of	the	man	who	had	passed	him	at	the	door—the	man

who,	he	suspected,	had	forced	an	entrance	to	his	rooms....

Alison	was	plucking	nervously	at	the	cover	without	lifting	it.

“Why	don’t	you	look?”	he	demanded,	irritated.

“I—I’m	afraid,”	she	said	in	a	broken	voice.

Nevertheless,	she	removed	the	cover.

For	a	solid,	silent	minute	both	stared,	stupefied.	The	hat	they	knew	so	well—the

big	black	hat	with	its	willow	plume	and	buckle	of	brilliants—had	vanished.	In	its

place	 they	 saw	 the	 tumbled	 wreckage	 of	 what	 had	 once	 been	 another	 hat

distinctly:	 wisps	 of	 straw	 dyed	 purple,	 fragments	 of	 feathers,	 bits	 of	 violet-coloured	 ribbon	 and	 silk	 which,	 mixed	 with	 wads	 and	 shreds	 of	 white	 tissue-paper,	filled	the	box	to	brimming.

Staff	 thrust	 a	 hand	 in	 his	 pocket	 and	 produced	 the	 knot	 of	 violet	 ribbon.	 It matched	exactly	the	torn	ribbon	in	the	box.

“So	that,”	he	murmured—“that’s	where	this	came	from!”

Alison	paid	no	attention.	Of	a	sudden	she	began	digging	furiously	in	the	débris

in	 the	 box,	 throwing	 out	 its	 contents	 by	 handfuls	 until	 she	 had	 uncovered	 the bottom	 without	 finding	 any	 sign	 of	 what	 she	 had	 thought	 to	 find.	 Then	 she paused,	meeting	his	gaze	with	one	half-wrathful,	half-hysterical.

“What	does	this	mean?”	she	demanded,	as	if	ready	to	hold	him	to	account.

“I	think,”	he	said	slowly—“I’m	strongly	inclined	to	believe	it	means	that	you’re

an	uncommonly	lucky	woman.”

“How	do	you	make	that	out?”	she	demanded	in	a	breath.

“I’ll	tell	you,”	he	said,	formulating	his	theory	as	he	spoke:	“When	I	came	home tonight,	 a	 man	 passed	 me	 at	 the	 door,	 fairly	 running	 out—I	 fancy,	 to	 escape recognition;	 there	 was	 something	 about	 him	 that	 seemed	 familiar.	 Then	 I	 came up	here,	found	my	door	ajar,	when	I	distinctly	remembered	locking	it,	found	my

windows	shut	and	the	shades	drawn,	when	I	distinctly	remembered	leaving	them

up,	and	finally	found	this	knot	of	ribbon	on	the	floor.	I	was	trying	to	account	for it	 when	 you	 drove	 up.	 Now	 it	 seems	 plain	 enough	 that	 this	 fellow	 knew	 or suspected	you	of	hiding	the	necklace	in	the	hat,	knew	that	I	had	it,	and	came	here in	my	absence	to	steal	it.	He	found	instead	this	hat,	and	knowing	no	better	tore	it to	pieces	trying	to	find	what	he	was	after.”

“But	where—where’s	 my	hat?”

“I’ll	tell	you.”	Staff	crossed	the	room	and	picked	up	the	string	and	label	which

had	 been	 on	 the	 box.	 Returning,	 he	 examined	 the	 tag	 and	 read	 aloud:	 “Miss Eleanor	Searle.”	He	handed	the	tag	to	Alison.	“Find	Miss	Searle	and	you’ll	find

your	 hat.	 It	 happens	 that	 she	 had	 a	 bandbox	 the	 exact	 duplicate	 of	 yours.	 I remember	telling	you	about	it,	on	the	steamer.	As	a	matter	of	fact,	she	was	in	the shop	the	afternoon	you	ordered	your	hat	sent	to	me,	though	she	steadily	refused

to	tell	me	who	was	responsible	for	that	imposition.	Now,	on	the	pier	today,	our

luggage	 was	 placed	 side	 by	 side,	 hers	 with	 mine—both	 in	 the	 S	 section,	 you understand.	 My	 examination	 was	 finished	 first	 and	 I	 was	 taken	 back	 to	 my stateroom	to	be	searched,	as	you	know.	While	I	was	gone,	her	examination	was

evidently	finished,	for	when	I	came	back	she	had	left	the	pier	with	all	her	things.

Quite	 plainly	 she	 must	 have	 taken	 your	 box	 by	 mistake	 for	 her	 own;	 this,	 of course,	is	her	hat.	As	I	said	at	first,	find	Miss	Searle	and	you’ll	find	your	hat	and necklace.	Also,	find	the	person	to	whom	you	confided	this	gay	young	swindling

scheme	 of	 yours,	 and	 you’ll	 find	 the	 man	 who	 was	 intimate	 enough	 with	 the affair	to	come	to	my	rooms	in	my	absence	and	go	direct	to	the	bandbox	for	the

necklace.”

“I—but	I	told	nobody,”	she	stammered.

By	the	look	in	her	eyes	he	disbelieved	her.

“Not	 even	 Max,	 this	 morning,	 before	 he	 offered	 that	 reward?”	 he	 asked

shrewdly.

“Well—yes;	I	told	him.”

“Max	may	have	confided	it	to	somebody	else:	these	things	spread.	Or	possibly

Jane	may	have	blabbed.”

“Oh,	no,”	she	protested,	but	without	conviction	in	her	accents;	“neither	of	them

would	be	so	foolish....”

“I’d	find	out,	if	I	were	you.”

“I	shall.	Meanwhile—this	Miss	Searle—where’s	she	stopping?”

“I	can’t	tell	you—some	hotel.	It’ll	be	easy	enough	to	find	her	in	the	morning.”

“Will	you	try?”

“Assuredly—the	first	thing.”

“Then—there	appears	to	be	nothing	else	to	do	but	go	home,”	said	the	woman	in

a	curiously	subdued	manner.

Without	replying	verbally,	Staff	took	up	her	chiffon	wrap	and	draped	it	over	her

shoulders.

“Thank	you,”	said	she,	moving	toward	the	door.	“Good	night.”

“Oh,”	he	protested	politely,	“I	must	see	you	out.”

“It’s	not	necessary—I	can	find	my	way.”

“But	only	I	know	how	to	fix	the	front	door.”

At	 the	 foot	 of	 the	 stairs,	 while	 he	 fumbled	 with	 the	 latch,	 doubting	 him,	 she spoke	with	some	little	hesitation.

“I	presume,”	she	said	stiffly—“I	presume	that	this—ah—ends	it.”

Staff	opened	the	door	an	inch	and	held	it	so.	“If	by	‘it,’”	he	replied,	“we	mean

the	same	thing—”

“We	do.”

“It	does,”	he	asseverated	with	his	twisted	smile.

She	delayed	an	instant	longer.	“But	all	the	same,”	she	said	hastily,	at	length,	“I want	that	play.”

“My	play?”	he	enquired	with	significant	emphasis.

“Yes,	of	course,”	she	said	sharply.

“Well,	 since	 I’m	 under	 contract	 with	 Max,	 I	 don’t	 well	 see	 how	 I	 can	 take	 it away	 from	 you.	 And	 besides,	 you’re	 the	 only	 woman	 living	 who	 can	 play	 it properly.”

“So	good	of	you.”	Her	hand	lay	slim	and	cool	in	his	for	the	fraction	of	an	instant.

“Good	night,”	she	iterated,	withdrawing	it.

“Good	night.”

As	 he	 let	 her	 out,	 Staff,	 glancing	 down	 at	 the	 waiting	 taxicab,	 was	 faintly surprised	by	the	discovery	that	she	had	not	come	alone.	A	man	stood	in	waiting

by	the	door—a	man	in	evening	clothes:	not	Max	but	a	taller	man,	more	slender,

with	a	better	carriage.	Turning	to	help	Alison	into	the	cab,	the	street	lights	threw his	face	in	sharp	relief	against	the	blackness	of	the	window;	and	Staff	knew	him.

“Arkroyd!”	he	said	beneath	his	breath.

He	 closed	 the	 door	 and	 set	 the	 latch,	 suffering	 from	 a	 species	 of	 mild astonishment.	His	psychological	processes	seemed	to	him	rather	unique;	he	felt

that	 he	 was	 hardly	 playing	 the	 game	 according	 to	 Hoyle.	 A	 man	 who	 has	 just broken	with	the	woman	with	whom	he	has	believed	himself	desperately	in	love

naturally	 counts	 on	 feeling	 a	 bit	 down	 in	 the	 mouth.	 And	 seeing	 her	 drive	 off with	 one	 whom	 he	 has	 every	 right	 to	 consider	 in	 the	 light	 of	 a	 hated	 rival,	 he ought	in	common	decency	to	suffer	poignant	pangs	of	jealousy.	But	Staff	didn’t;

he	 couldn’t	 honestly	 make	 himself	 believe	 that	 he	 was	 suffering	 in	 any	 way whatever.	Indeed,	the	most	violent	emotion	to	which	he	was	sensible	was	one	of

chagrin	over	his	own	infatuate	myopia.

“Ass!”	he	called	himself,	slowly	reascending	the	stairs.	“You	might	’ve	seen	this

coming	long	ago,	if	you	hadn’t	wilfully	chosen	to	be	blind	as	a	bat!”

Re-entering	his	study,	he	pulled	up	with	a	start	and	a	cry	of	sincere	amazement.

“Well,	I’ll	be	damned!”

“Then	why	not	lead	a	better	life?”	enquired	Mr.	Iff.

He	 was	 standing	 in	 the	 doorway	 to	 the	 bedroom,	 looking	 much	 like	 an

exceptionally	cruel	caricature	of	himself.	As	he	spoke,	he	slouched	wearily	over

to	the	wing-chair	Alison	had	recently	occupied,	and	dropped	into	it	like	a	dead

weight.

He	wore	no	hat.	His	clothing	was	in	a	shocking	condition,	damp,	shapeless	and

shrunken	 to	 such	 an	 extent	 as	 to	 disclose	 exhibits	 of	 bony	 wrists	 and	 ankles almost	 immodestly	 generous.	 On	 his	 bird-like	 cranium	 the	 pale,	 smooth	 scalp shone	 pink	 through	 scanty,	 matted,	 damp	 blond	 locks.	 His	 face	 was	 drawn, pinched	 and	 pale.	 As	 if	 new	 to	 the	 light	 his	 baby-blue	 eyes	 blinked	 furiously.

Round	his	thin	lips	hovered	his	habitual	smile,	semi-sardonic,	semi-sheepish.

“Do	 you	 mind	 telling	 me	 how	 in	 thunder	 you	 got	 in	 here?”	 asked	 Staff

courteously.

Iff	waved	a	hand	toward	the	bedroom.

“Fire-escape,”	he	admitted	wearily.	“Happened	to	see	your	light	and	thought	I’d

call.	Hope	I	don’t	intrude....	Got	anything	to	drink?	I’m	about	all	in.”





IX

A	LIKELY	STORY

“If	 I’m	 any	 judge, that’s	 no	 exaggeration.”	 Thus	 Mr.	 Staff	 after	 a	 moment’s pause	which	he	utilised	to	look	Mr.	Iff	over	with	a	critical	eye.

Mr.	Iff	wagged	his	head.	“Believe	 me,”	said	he	simply.

Staff	fetched	a	decanter	of	Scotch	and	a	glass,	placing	them	on	the	table	by	Iff’s elbow,	then	turned	away	to	get	a	siphon	of	charged	water	from	the	icebox.	But

by	the	time	he	was	back	a	staggering	amount	of	whiskey	had	disappeared	from

the	 decanter,	 a	 moist	 but	 empty	 glass	 stood	 beside	 it,	 and	 Mr.	 Iff	 was	 stroking smiling	lips	with	his	delicate,	claw-like	fingers.	He	discontinued	this	occupation long	enough	to	wave	the	siphon	away.

“Not	for	me,”	he	said	tersely.	“I’ve	swallowed	enough	water	this	night	to	last	me

for	the	rest	of	my	life—half	of	the	North	River,	more	or	less;	rather	more,	if	you ask	me.”

“What	were	you	doing	in	the	North	River?”

“Swimming.”

This	answer	was	evidently	so	adequate	in	Mr.	Iff’s	understanding	that	he	made

no	 effort	 to	 elaborate	 upon	 it;	 so	 that	 presently,	 growing	 impatient,	 Staff	 felt called	upon	to	ask:

“Well?	What	were	you	swimming	for?”

“Dear	life,”	said	Iff—“life,	liberty	and	the	pursuit	of	happiness:	the	incontestable birthright	of	every	freeborn	American	citizen—if	you	must	know.”

He	relapsed	into	a	reverie	which	seemed	hugely	diverting	from	the	reminiscent

twinkle	 in	 the	 little	 man’s	 eyes.	 From	 this	 he	 emerged	 long	 enough	 to	 remark:

“That’s	prime	whiskey,	you	know....	Thanks	very	much,	I	will.”	And	again	fell

silent,	stroking	his	lips.

“I	don’t	want	to	seem	to	pry,”	said	Staff	at	length,	with	elaborate	irony;	“but	in view	of	the	fact	that	you’ve	felt	warranted	in	calling	on	me	via	the	fire-escape	at

one	 A.M.,	 it	 doesn’t	 seem	 unreasonable	 of	 me	 to	 expect	 some	 sort	 of	 an explanation.”

“Oh,	very	well,”	returned	Iff,	with	resignation.	“What	would	you	like	to	know?”

“Why	did	you	disappear	this	morning—?”

“Yesterday	morning,”	Iff	corrected	dispassionately.

“—yesterday	morning,	and	how?”

“Because	the	time	seemed	ripe	for	me	to	do	my	marvellous	vanishing	stunt.	You

see,	I	had	a	hunch	that	the	dear	captain	would	turn	things	over	in	his	mind	and

finally	 determine	 not	 to	 accept	 my	 credentials	 at	 their	 face	 value.	 So	 I	 kind	 of stuck	round	the	wireless	room	with	my	ears	intelligently	pricked	forward.	Sure

enough,	 presently	 I	 heard	 the	 message	 go	 out,	 asking	 what	 about	 me	 and	 how so.”

“You	mean	you	read	the	operator’s	sending	by	ear?”

“Sure;	 I’ve	 got	 a	 telegrapher’s	 ear	 as	 long	 as	 a	 mule’s....	 Whereupon,	 knowing just	about	what	sort	of	an	answer	’d	come	through,	I	made	up	my	mind	to	duck.

And	did.”

“But	how—?”

“That’d	 be	 telling,	 and	 telling	 would	 get	 somebody	 aboard	 the	 Autocratic	 into terrible	bad	trouble	if	it	ever	leaked	out.	I	crawled	in	out	of	the	weather—let	it go	at	that.	I	wish,”	said	Mr.	Iff	soulfully,	“those	damn’	Pinkerton	men	had	let	it go	 at	 that.	 Once	 or	 twice	 I	 really	 thought	 they	 had	 me,	 or	 would	 have	 me	 the next	minute.	And	they	wouldn’t	give	up.	That’s	why	I	had	to	take	to	the	water,

after	 dark.	 My	 friend,	 who	 shall	 be	 nameless,	 lent	 me	 the	 loan	 of	 a	 rope	 and	 I shinned	down	and	had	a	nice	little	swim	before	I	found	a	place	to	crawl	ashore.	I

assure	 you	 that	 the	 North	 River	 tastes	 like	 hell....	 O	 thank	 you;	 don’t	 mind	 if	 I do.”

“Then,”	 said	 Staff,	 watching	 the	 little	 man	 help	 himself	 on	 his	 own	 invitation

—“Then	you	are	Ismay!”

“Wrong	 again,”	 said	 Iff	 drearily.	 “Honest,	 it’s	 a	 real	 shame,	 the	 way	 you	 can’t seem	to	win	any	bets	at	all.”

“If	you’re	not	Ismay,	what	made	you	hide?”

“Ah!”	 cried	 Iff	 admiringly—“shrewd	 and	 pertinent	 question!	 Now	 I’ll	 tell	 you, and	 you	 won’t	 believe	 me.	 Because—now	 pay	 strict	 attention—because	 we’re

near-twins.”

“Who	are	twins?”	demanded	Staff	staring.

“Him	and	me—Ismay	and	I-double-F.	First	cousins	we	are:	his	mother	was	my

aunt.	 Worse	 and	 more	 of	 it:	 our	 fathers	 were	 brothers.	 They	 married	 the	 same day;	Ismay	and	I	were	born	in	the	same	month.	We	look	just	enough	alike	to	be

mistaken	 for	 one	 another	 when	 we’re	 not	 together.	 That’s	 been	 a	 great	 help	 to him;	he’s	made	me	more	trouble	than	I’ve	time	to	tell	you.	The	last	time,	I	was

pinched	in	his	place	and	escaped	a	penitentiary	sentence	by	the	narrowest	kind

of	 a	 shave.	 That	 got	 my	 mad	 up,	 and	 I	 served	 notice	 on	 him	 to	 quit	 his foolishness	 or	 I’d	 get	 after	 him.	 He	 replied	 by	 cooking	 up	 a	 fine	 little	 scheme that	almost	laid	me	by	the	heels	again.	So	I	declared	war	and	’ve	been	camping

on	his	trail	ever	since.”

He	paused	and	twiddled	his	thumbs,	staring	reflectively	at	the	ceiling.	“I’m	sure

I	don’t	know	why	I	bore	myself	telling	you	all	this.	What’s	the	use?”

“Never	mind,”	said	Staff	in	an	encouraging	manner;	he	was	genuinely	diverted.

“At	worst	it’s	a	worthy	and	uplifting—ah—fiction.	Go	on....	Then	you’re	not	a

Secret	Service	man	after	all?”

“Nothing	like	that;	I’m	doing	this	thing	on	my	own.”

“How	about	that	forged	paper	you	showed	the	captain?”

“Wasn’t	forged—genuine.”

“Chapter	Two,”	observed	Staff,	leaning	back.	“It	is	a	dark	and	stormy	night;	we

are	all	seated	about	the	camp-fire.	The	captain	says:	‘Antonio,	go	to	it.’”

“You	 are	 certainly	 one	 swell,	 appreciative	 audience,”	 commented	 Iff	 morosely.

“Let’s	 see	 if	 I	 can’t	 get	 a	 laugh	 with	 this	 one:	 One	 of	 the	 best	 little	 things	 my dear	little	cousin	does	being	to	pass	himself	off	as	me,	he	got	himself	hired	by

the	Treasury	Department	some	years	ago	under	the	name	of	William	Howard	Iff.

That	helped	him	a	lot	in	his	particular	line	of	business.	But	after	a	while	he	felt that	 it	 cramped	 his	 style,	 so	 he	 just	 faded	 noiselessly	 away—retaining	 his credentials.	 Then—while	 I	 was	 in	 Paris	 last	 week—he	 thought	 it	 would	 be	 a grand	 joke	 to	 send	 me	 that	 document	 with	 his	 compliments	 and	 the	 suggestion that	 it	 might	 be	 some	 help	 to	 me	 in	 my	 campaign	 for	 his	 scalp.	 That’s	 how	 I

happened	to	have	it.”

“That’s	going	some,”	Staff	admitted	admiringly.	“Tell	me	another	one. If	you’re Iff	and	not	Ismay,	what	brought	you	over	on	the	Autocratic?”

“Business	of	keeping	an	eye	on	my	dearly	beloved	cousin,”	said	Iff	promptly.

“You	mean	Ismay	was	on	board,	too?”

“’Member	that	undergrown	waster	with	the	red-and-grey	Vandyke	and	the	horn-

rimmed	 pince	nez,	who	was	always	mooning	round	with	a	book	under	his	arm?”

“Yes....”

“That	was	Cousin	Arbuthnot	disguised	in	his	own	hair.”

“If	that	was	so,	why	didn’t	you	denounce	him	when	you	were	accused	of	stealing

the	Cadogan	collar?”

“Because	I	knew	he	hadn’t	got	away	with	it.”

“How	did	you	know?”

“At	least	I	was	pretty	positive	about	it.	You’ll	have	to	be	patient—and	intelligent

—if	you	want	to	understand	and	follow	me	back	to	Paris.	The	three	of	us	were

there:	Ismay,	Miss	Landis,	myself.	Miss	Landis	was	dickering	with	Cottier’s	for

the	necklace,	Ismay	sticking	round	and	not	losing	sight	of	her	much	of	the	time,

I	was	looking	after	Ismay.	Miss	Landis	buys	the	collar	and	a	ticket	for	London;

Ismay	 buys	 a	 ticket	 for	 London;	 I	 trail.	 Then	 Miss	 Landis	 makes	 another purchase—a	razor,	in	a	shop	near	the	hotel	where	I	happen	to	be	loafing.”

“A	razor!”

“That’s	 the	 way	 it	 struck	 me,	 too....	 Scene	 Two:	 Cockspur	 Street,	 London.	 I’m not	 sure	 what	 boat	 Miss	 Landis	 means	 to	 take;	 I’ve	 got	 a	 notion	 it’s	 the Autocratic,	but	I’m	stalling	till	I	know.	You	drift	into	the	office,	I	recognise	you and	recall	that	you’re	pretty	thick	with	Miss	Landis.	Nothing	more	natural	than

that	you	and	she	should	go	home	by	the	same	steamer.	Similarly—Ismay....	Oh,

yes,	 I	 understand	 it	 was	 pure	 coincidence;	 but	 I	 took	 a	 chance	 and	 filled	 my hand.	 After	 we’d	 booked	 and	 you’d	 strutted	 off,	 I	 lingered	 long	 enough	 to	 see Miss	Landis	drive	up	in	a	taxi	with	a	whaling	big	bandbox	on	top	of	the	cab.	She

booked	right	under	my	nose;	I	made	a	note	of	the	bandbox....

“Then	you	came	aboard	with	the	identical	bandbox	and	your	funny	story	about how	 you	 happened	 to	 have	 it.	 I	 smelt	 a	 rat:	 Miss	 Landis	 hadn’t	 sent	 you	 that bandbox	 anonymously	 for	 no	 purpose.	 Then	 one	 afternoon—long	 toward	 six

o’clock—I	 see	 Miss	 Landis’s	 maid	 come	 out	 on	 deck	 and	 jerk	 a	 little	 package overboard—package	 just	 about	 big	 enough	 to	 hold	 a	 razor.	 That	 night	 I’m dragged	up	on	the	carpet	before	the	captain;	I	hear	a	pretty	fairy	tale	about	the

collar	 disappearing	 while	 Jane	 was	 taking	 the	 bandbox	 back	 to	 your	 steward.

The	handbag	is	on	the	table,	in	plain	sight;	it	isn’t	locked—a	blind	man	can	see

that;	and	the	slit	in	its	side	has	been	made	by	a	razor.	I	add	up	the	bandbox	and

the	razor	and	multiply	the	sum	by	the	fact	that	the	average	woman	will	smuggle

as	quick	as	the	average	man	will	take	a	drink;	and	I’m	Jeremiah	Wise,	Esquire.”

“That’s	the	best	yet,”	Staff	applauded.	“But—see	here—why	didn’t	you	tell	what

you	knew,	if	you	knew	so	much,	when	you	were	accused?”

Iff	grimaced	sourly.	“Get	ready	to	laugh.	This	is	one	you	won’t	fall	for—not	in	a

thousand	years.”

“Shoot,”	said	Staff.

“I	 like	 you,”	 said	 Iff	 simply.	 “You’re	 foolish	 in	 the	 head	 sometimes,	 but	 in	 the main	you	mean	well.”

“That’s	nice	of	you—but	what	has	it	to	do	with	my	question?”

“Everything.	 You’re	 sweet	 on	 the	 girl,	 and	 I	 don’t	 wish	 to	 put	 a	 crimp	 in	 your young	romance	by	showing	her	up	in	her	true	colours.	Furthermore,	you	may	be

hep	to	her	little	scheme;	I	don’t	believe	it,	but	I	know	that,	if	you	are,	you	won’t let	me	suffer	for	it.	And	finally,	in	the	senility	of	my	dotage	I	conned	myself	into believing	 I	 could	 bluff	 it	 out;	 at	 the	 worst,	 I	 could	 prove	 my	 innocence	 easily enough.	 But	 what	 I	 didn’t	 take	 into	 consideration	 was	 that	 I	 was	 laying	 myself open	to	arrest	for	impersonating	an	agent	of	the	Government.	When	I	woke	up	to

that	fact,	the	only	thing	I	could	see	to	do	was	to	duck	in	out	of	the	blizzard.”

Staff	said	sententiously:	“Hmmm. ...”

“Pretty	thin—what?”

“In	 spots,”	 Staff	 agreed.	 “Still,	 I’ve	 got	 to	 admit	 you’ve	 managed	 to	 cover	 the canvas,	even	if	your	supply	of	paint	was	a	bit	stingy.	One	thing	still	bothers	me: how	did	you	find	out	I	knew	about	the	smuggling	game?”

Iff	nodded	toward	the	bedroom.	“I	happened	in—casually,	as	the	saying	runs—

just	as	Miss	Landis	was	telling	on	herself.”

Staff	frowned.

“How,”	 he	 pursued	 presently,	 “can	 I	 feel	 sure	 you’re	 not	 Ismay,	 and,	 having guessed	as	accurately	as	you	did,	that	you	didn’t	get	at	that	bandbox	aboard	the

ship	and	take	the	necklace?”

“If	I	were,	and	had,	would	I	be	here?”

“But	I	can’t	understand	why	you	are	here!”

“It’s	simple	enough;	I’ve	any	number	of	reasons	for	inviting	myself	to	be	your

guest.	For	one,	I’m	wet	and	cold	and	look	like	a	drowned	rat;	I	can’t	offer	myself to	a	hotel	looking	like	this—can	I?	Then	I	knew	your	address—you’ll	remember

telling	me;	and	there’s	an	adage	that	runs	‘Any	port	in	a	storm.’	You’re	going	to

be	 good	 enough	 to	 get	 my	 money	 changed—I’ve	 nothing	 but	 English	 paper—

and	buy	me	a	ready-made	outfit	in	the	morning.	Moreover,	I’m	after	Ismay,	and

Ismay’s	 after	 the	 necklace;	 wherever	 it	 is,	 he	 will	 be,	 soon	 or	 late.	 Naturally	 I presumed	you	still	had	it—and	so	did	he	until	within	the	hour.”

“You	mean	you	think	it	was	Ismay	who	broke	into	these	rooms	tonight?”

“You	 saw	 him,	 didn’t	 you?	 Man	 about	 my	 size,	 wasn’t	 he?	 Evening	 clothes?

That’s	his	regulation	uniform	after	dark.	Beard	and	glasses—what?”

“I	 believe	 you’re	 right!”	 Staff	 rose	 excitedly.	 “I	 didn’t	 notice	 the	 glasses,	 but otherwise	you’ve	described	him!”

“What	did	I	tell	you?”	Iff	helped	himself	to	a	cigarette.	“By	now	the	dirty	dog’s

probably	 raising	 heaven	 and	 hell	 to	 find	 out	 where	 Miss	 Searle	 has	 hidden herself.”

Staff	 began	 to	 pace	 nervously	 to	 and	 fro.	 “I	 wish,”	 he	 cried,	 “I	 knew	 where	 to find	her!”

“Please,”	Iff	begged	earnestly,	“don’t	let	your	sense	of	the	obligations	of	a	host interfere	with	your	amusements;	but	if	you’ll	stop	that	Marathon	long	enough	to

find	me	a	blanket,	I’ll	shed	these	rags	and,	by	your	good	leave,	curl	up	cunningly on	yon	divan.”

Staff	 paused,	 stared	 at	 the	 little	 man’s	 bland	 and	 guileless	 face,	 and	 shook	 his

head	helplessly,	laughing.

“There’s	 no	 resisting	 your	 colossal	 gall,”	 he	 said,	 passing	 into	 the	 adjoining room	to	get	bed-clothing	for	his	guest.

“I	admit	it,”	said	Iff	placidly.

As	 Staff	 returned,	 the	 telephone	 bell	 rang.	 In	 his	 surprise	 he	 paused	 with	 his arms	full	of	sheets,	blankets	and	pillows,	and	stared	incredulously	at	his	desk.

“What	the	deuce	now?”	he	murmured.

“The	 quickest	 way	 to	 an	 answer	 to	 that,”	 suggested	 Iff	 blandly,	 “is	 there.”	 He indicated	the	telephone	with	an	ample	gesture.	“Help	yourself.”

Dropping	his	burden	on	the	divan,	Staff	seated	himself	at	the	desk	and	took	up

the	receiver.

“Hello?”

He	started	violently,	recognising	the	voice	that	answered:	“Mr.	Staff?”

“Yes—”

“This	is	Miss	Searle.”

“I	know,”	he	stammered;	“I—I	knew	your	voice.”

“Really?”	The	query	was	perfunctory.	“Mr.	Staff—I	couldn’t	wait	to	tell	you—

I’ve	just	got	in	from	a	theatre	and	supper	party	with	some	friends.”

“Yes,”	he	said.	“Where	are	you?”

Disregarding	 his	 question,	 the	 girl’s	 voice	 continued	 quickly:	 “I	 wanted	 to	 see my	hat	and	opened	the	bandbox.	It	wasn’t	my	hat—it’s	the	one	you	described—

the	one	that—”

“I	know,”	he	interrupted;	“I	know	all	about	that	now.”

“Yes,”	she	went	on	hurriedly,	unheeding	his	words.	“I	admired	and	examined	it.

It—there’s	something	else.”

“I	know,”	he	said	again;	“the	Cadogan	collar.”

“Oh!”	There	was	an	accent	of	surprise	in	her	voice.	“Well,	I’ve	ordered	a	taxi,

and	I’m	going	to	bring	it	to	you	right	away.	The	thing’s	too	valuable—”

“Miss	Searle—”

“I’m	 afraid	 to	 keep	 it	 here.	 I	 wanted	 to	 find	 out	 if	 you	 were	 up—that’s	 why	 I called.”

“But,	Miss	Searle—”

“The	taxi’s	waiting	now.	I’ll	be	at	your	door	in	fifteen	minutes.”

“But—”

“Good-bye.”

He	 heard	 the	 click	 as	 she	 hung	 up	 the	 receiver;	 and	 nothing	 more.	 With	 an exclamation	of	annoyance	he	swung	round	from	the	desk.

“Somebody	coming?”	enquired	Iff	brightly.

Staff	eyed	him	with	overt	distrust.	“Yes,”	he	said	reluctantly.

“Miss	Searle	bringing	the	evanescent	collar,	eh?”

Staff	nodded	curtly.

“Plagued	nuisance,”	commented	Iff.	“And	me	wanting	to	go	to	sleep	the	worst	I

ever	did.”

“Don’t	let	this	keep	you	up,”	said	Staff.

“But,”	Iff	remonstrated,	“you	can’t	receive	a	lady	in	here	with	me	asleep	on	your

divan.”

“I	don’t	intend	to,”	Staff	told	him	bluntly.	“I’m	going	to	meet	the	taxi	at	the	door, get	into	it	with	her,	and	take	that	infernal	necklace	directly	to	Miss	Landis,	at	her hotel.”

“The	 more	 I	 see	 of	 you,”	 said	 Mr.	 Iff,	 removing	 his	 coat,	 “the	 more	 qualities	 I discover	 in	 you	 to	 excite	 my	 admiration	 and	 liking.	 As	 in	 this	 instance	 when with	 thoughtfulness	 for	 my	 comfort”—he	 tore	 from	 his	 neck	 the	 water-soaked rag	 that	 had	 been	 his	 collar—“you	 combine	 a	 prudent,	 not	 to	 say	 sagacious foresight,	whereby	you	plan	to	place	the	Cadogan	collar	far	beyond	my	reach	in

event	I	should	turn	out	to	be	a	gay	deceiver.”

By	way	of	response,	Staff	found	his	hat	and	placed	it	handily	on	the	table,	went to	his	desk	and	took	from	one	of	its	drawers	a	small	revolver	of	efficient	aspect, unloaded	and	reloaded	it	to	satisfy	himself	it	was	in	good	working	order—and	of

a	sudden	looked	round	suspiciously	at	Mr.	Iff.

The	latter,	divested	of	his	clothing	and	swathed	in	a	dressing-gown	several	sizes

too	 large	 for	 him,	 fulfilled	 his	 host’s	 expectations	 by	 laughing	 openly	 at	 these warlike	preparations.

“I	 infer,”	 he	 said,	 “that	 you	 wouldn’t	 be	 surprised	 to	 meet	 up	 with	 Cousin Arbuthnot	before	sunrise.”

“I’m	taking	no	chances,”	Staff	announced	with	dignity.

“Well,	 if	 you	 should	 meet	 him,	 and	 if	 you	 mean	 what	 you	 act	 like, and	 if	 that gun’s	any	good, and	if	you	know	how	to	use	it,”	yawned	Mr.	Iff,	“you’ll	do	me	a favour	and	save	me	a	heap	of	trouble	into	the	bargain. Good	night.”

He	 yawned	 again	 in	 a	 most	 business-like	 way,	 lay	 down,	 pulled	 a	 blanket	 up round	his	ears,	turned	his	back	to	the	light	and	was	presently	breathing	with	the

sweet	and	steady	regularity	of	a	perfectly	sound	and	sincere	sleeper.

To	make	his	rest	the	more	comfortable,	Staff	turned	off	all	the	lights	save	that	on his	 desk.	 Then	 he	 filled	 a	 pipe	 and	 sat	 down	 to	 envy	 the	 little	 man.	 The	 very name	of	sleep	was	music	in	his	hearing,	just	then.

The	minutes	lagged	on	leaden	wings.	There	was	a	great	hush	in	the	old	house,

and	the	street	itself	was	quiet.	Once	or	twice	Staff	caught	himself	nodding;	then

he	 would	 straighten	 up,	 steel	 his	 will	 and	 spur	 his	 senses	 to	 attention,	 waiting, listening,	straining	to	catch	the	sound	of	an	approaching	taxi.	He	seemed	to	hear

every	 imaginable	 night	 noise	 but	 that:	 the	 crash	 and	 whine	 of	 trolleys,	 the footsteps	of	a	scattered	handful	of	belated	pedestrians,	the	infrequent	windy	roar of	trains	on	the	Third	Avenue	L,	empty	clapping	of	horses’	hoofs	on	the	asphalt

...	 the	 yowl	 of	 a	 sentimental	 tomcat	 ...	 a	 dull	 and	 distant	 grumble,	 vague, formless,	like	a	long,	unending	roll	of	thunder	down	the	horizon	...	the	swish	and sough	 of	 waters	 breaking	 away	 from	 the	 flanks	 of	 the	 Autocratic	 ...	 and	 then, finally,	like	a	tocsin,	the	sonorous,	musical	chiming	of	the	grandfather’s	clock	in the	corner.

He	 found	 himself	 on	 his	 feet,	 rubbing	 his	 eyes,	 with	 a	 mouth	 dry	 as	 paper,	 a thumping	heart,	and	a	vague	sense	of	emptiness	in	his	middle.

Had	 he	 napped—slept?	 How	 long?...	 He	 stared,	 bewildered,	 groping	 blindly after	his	wandering	wits....

The	windows,	that	had	been	black	oblongs	in	the	illuminated	walls,	were	filled

with	a	cool	and	shapeless	tone	of	grey.	He	reeled	(rather	than	walked)	to	one	of

them	and	looked	out.

The	 street	 below	 was	 vacant,	 desolate	 and	 uncannily	 silent,	 showing	 a	 harsh, unlovely	countenance	like	the	jaded	mask	of	some	sodden	reveller,	with	bleary

street-lamps	for	eyes—all	mean	and	garish	in	the	chilly	dusk	that	foreruns	dawn.

Hastily	Staff	consulted	his	watch.

Four	o’clock!

It	 occurred	 to	 him	 that	 the	 watch	 needed	 winding,	 and	 he	 stood	 for	 several seconds	 twisting	 the	 stem-crown	 between	 thumb	 and	 forefinger	 while	 stupidly comprehending	 the	 fact	 that	 he	 must	 have	 been	 asleep	 between	 two	 and	 three hours.

Abruptly,	in	a	fit	of	witless	agitation,	he	crossed	to	the	divan,	caught	the	sleeper by	the	shoulder	and	shook	him	till	he	wakened—till	he	rolled	over	on	his	back,

grunted	and	opened	one	eye.

“Look	here!”	said	Staff	in	a	quaver—“I’ve	been	asleep!”

“You’ve	got	nothing	on	me,	then,”	retorted	Iff	with	pardonable	asperity.	“All	the

same—congratulations.	Good	 night.”

He	attempted	to	turn	over	again,	but	was	restrained	by	Staff’s	imperative	hand.

“It’s	four	o’clock,	and	after!”

“I	admit	it.	You	might	be	good	enough	to	leave	a	call	for	me	for	eleven.”

“But—damn	it,	man!—that	cab	hasn’t	come—”

“I	can’t	help	that,	can	I?”

“I’m	afraid	something	has	happened	to	that	girl.”

“Well,	it’s	too	late	to	prevent	it	now—if	so.”

“Good	God!	Have	you	no	heart,	man?”	Staff	began	to	stride	distractedly	up	and

down	the	room.	“What	am	I	to	do?”	he	groaned	aloud.

“Take	unkie’s	advice	and	go	bye-bye,”	suggested	Iff.	“Otherwise	I’d	be	obliged

if	you’d	rehearse	that	turn	in	the	other	room.	I’m	going	to	sleep	if	I	have	to	brain you	to	get	quiet.”

Staff	 stopped	 as	 if	 somebody	 had	 slapped	 him:	 the	 telephone	 bell	 was	 ringing again.

He	 flung	 himself	 across	 the	 room,	 dropped	 heavily	 into	 the	 chair	 and	 snatched up	the	receiver.

A	man’s	voice	stammered	drowsily	his	number.

“Yes,”	he	almost	shouted.	“Yes—Mr.	Staff	at	the	’phone.	Who	wants	me?”

“Hold	the	wire.”

He	heard	a	buzzing,	a	click;	then	silence;	a	prolonged	 brrrrp	and	another	click.

“Hello?”	he	called.	“Hello?”

His	heart	jumped:	the	voice	was	Miss	Searle’s.

“Mr.	Staff?”

It	seemed	to	him	that	he	could	detect	a	tremor	in	her	accents,	as	if	she	were	both weary	and	frightened.

“Yes,	Miss	Searle.	What	is	it?”

“I	wanted	to	reassure	you—I’ve	had	a	terrible	experience,	but	I’m	all	right	now

—safe.	I	started—”

Her	voice	ceased	to	vibrate	over	the	wires	as	suddenly	as	if	those	same	wires	had

been	cut.

“Yes?”	he	cried	after	an	instant.	“Yes,	Miss	Searle?	Hello,	hello!”

There	 was	 no	 answer.	 Listening	 with	 every	 faculty	 at	 high	 tension,	 he	 fancied that	he	detected	a	faint,	abrupt	sound,	like	a	muffled	sob.	On	the	heels	of	it	came a	click	and	the	connection	was	broken.

In	his	anxiety	and	consternation	he	swore	violently.

“Well,	what’s	the	trouble?”

Iff	 stood	 at	 his	 side,	 now	 wide-awake	 and	 quick	 with	 interest.	 Hastily	 Staff explained	what	had	happened.

“Yes,”	nodded	the	little	man.	“Yes,	that’d	be	the	way	of	it.	She	had	trouble,	but

managed	to	get	to	the	telephone;	then	somebody	grabbed	her—”

“Somebody!	Who?”	Staff	demanded	unreasonably.

“I	don’t	really	know—honest	Injun!	But	there’s	a	smell	of	garlic	about	it,	just	the same.”

“Smell	of	garlic!	Are	you	mad?”

“Tush!”	 said	 Mr.	 Iff	 contemptuously.	 “I	 referred	 poetically	 to	 the	 fine	 Italian hand	of	Cousin	Arbuthnot	Ismay.	Now	if	I	were	you,	I’d	agitate	that	hook	until

Central	 answers,	 and	 then	 ask	 for	 the	 manager	 and	 see	 if	 he	 can	 trace	 that	 call back	 to	 its	 source.	 It	 oughtn’t	 to	 be	 difficult	 at	 this	 hour,	 when	 the	 telephone service	is	at	its	slackest.”

He	fancied	that	he	detected	a	faint,	abrupt	sound,	like	a	muffled	sob

DEAD	O’	NIGHT

Beneath	 a	 nature	 so	 superficially	 shallow	 that	 it	 shone	 only	 with	 the	 reflected lustre	of	the	more	brilliant	personalities	to	which	it	was	attracted,	Mrs.	Ilkington had	 a	 heart—sentiment	 and	 a	 capacity	 for	 sympathetic	 affection.	 She	 had	 met Eleanor	Searle	in	Paris,	and	knew	a	little	more	than	something	of	the	struggle	the girl	 had	 been	 making	 to	 prepare	 herself	 for	 the	 operatic	 stage.	 She	 managed	 to discover	that	she	had	no	close	friends	in	New	York,	and	shrewdly	surmised	that

she	wasn’t	any	too	well	provided	with	munitions	of	war—in	the	shape	of	money

—for	 her	 contemplated	 campaign	 against	 the	 army	 of	 professional	 people,

marshalled	 by	 indifferent-minded	 managers,	 which	 stood	 between	 her	 and	 the place	she	coveted.

Considering	all	this,	Mrs.	Ilkington	had	suggested,	with	an	accent	of	insistence,

that	 Eleanor	 should	 go	 to	 the	 hotel	 which	 she	 intended	 to	 patronise—wording her	 suggestion	 so	 cunningly	 that	 it	 would	 be	 an	 easy	 matter	 for	 her,	 when	 the time	came,	to	demonstrate	that	she	had	invited	the	girl	to	be	her	guest.	And	with

this	 she	 was	 thoughtful	 enough	 to	 select	 an	 unpretentious	 if	 thoroughly	 well-managed	 house	 on	 the	 West	 Side,	 in	 the	 late	 Seventies,	 in	 order	 that	 Eleanor might	feel	at	ease	and	not	worry	about	the	size	of	the	bill	which	she	wasn’t	to	be permitted	to	pay.

Accordingly	the	two	ladies	(with	Mr.	Bangs	tagging)	went	from	the	pier	directly

to	the	St.	Simon,	the	elder	woman	to	stay	until	her	town-house	could	be	opened

and	put	in	order,	the	girl	while	she	looked	round	for	a	spinster’s	studio	or	a	small apartment	within	her	limited	means.

Promptly	on	their	arrival	at	the	hotel,	Mrs.	Ilkington	began	to	run	up	a	telephone bill,	 notifying	 friends	 of	 her	 whereabouts;	 with	 the	 result	 (typical	 of	 the	 New York	idea)	that	within	an	hour	she	had	engaged	herself	for	a	dinner	with	theatre

and	supper	to	follow—and,	of	course,	had	managed	to	have	Eleanor	included	in

the	 invitation.	 She	 was	 one	 of	 those	 women	 who	 live	 on	 their	 nerves	 and apparently	 thrive	 on	 excitement,	 ignorant	 of	 the	 meaning	 of	 rest	 save	 in association	with	those	rest-cure	sanatoriums	to	which	they	repair	for	a	fortnight

semi-annually—or	oftener.

Against	her	protests,	then,	Eleanor	was	dragged	out	in	full	dress	when	what	she really	wanted	to	do	was	to	eat	a	light	and	simple	meal	and	go	early	to	bed.	In	not unnatural	 consequence	 she	 found	 herself,	 when	 they	 got	 home	 after	 one	 in	 the morning,	 in	 a	 state	 of	 nervous	 disquiet	 caused	 by	 the	 strain	 of	 keeping	 herself keyed	up	to	the	pitch	of	an	animated	party.

Insomnia	stared	her	in	the	face	with	its	blind,	blank	eyes.	In	the	privacy	of	her

own	room,	she	expressed	a	free	opinion	of	her	countrymen,	conceiving	them	all

in	the	guise	of	fevered,	unquiet	souls	cast	in	the	mould	of	Mrs.	Ilkington.

Divesting	 herself	 of	 her	 dinner-gown,	 she	 slipped	 into	 a	 négligée	 and	 looked round	for	a	book,	meaning	to	read	herself	sleepy.	In	the	course	of	her	search	she

happened	to	recognise	her	bandbox	and	conceive	a	desire	to	reassure	herself	as

to	the	becomingness	of	its	contents.

The	 hat	 she	 found	 therein	 was	 becoming	 enough,	 even	 if	 it	 wasn’t	 hers.	 The mistake	 was	 easily	 apparent	 and	 excusable,	 considering	 the	 confusion	 that	 had obtained	on	the	pier	at	the	time	of	their	departure.

She	 wondered	 when	 Staff	 would	 learn	 the	 secret	 of	 his	 besetting	 mystery,	 and wondered	 too	 why	 Alison	 had	 wished	 to	 make	 a	 mystery	 of	 it.	 The	 joke	 was hardly	 apparent—though	 one’s	 sense	 of	 American	 humour	 might	 well	 have

become	dulled	in	several	years	of	residence	abroad.

Meanwhile,	 instinctively,	 Eleanor	 was	 trying	 on	 the	 hat	 before	 the	 long	 mirror set	in	the	door	of	the	closet.	She	admitted	to	herself	that	she	looked	astonishingly well	 in	 it.	 She	 was	 a	 sane	 and	 sensible	 young	 woman,	 who	 knew	 that	 she	 was exceedingly	 good	 looking	 and	 was	 glad	 of	 it	 in	 the	 same	 wholesome	 way	 that she	was	glad	she	had	a	good	singing	voice.	Very	probably	the	hat	was	more	of	a

piece	 with	 the	 somewhat	 flamboyant	 if	 unimpeachable	 loveliness	 of	 Alison

Landis;	but	it	would	seem	hard	to	find	a	hat	better	suited	to	set	off	the	handsome, tall	and	slightly	pale	girl	that	confronted	Eleanor	in	the	mirror.

It	seemed	surprisingly	heavy,	even	for	a	hat	of	its	tremendous	size.	She	was	of

the	opinion	that	it	would	make	her	head	ache	to	wear	it	for	many	hours	at	a	time.

She	 was	 puzzled	 by	 its	 weight	 and	 speculated	 vaguely	 about	 it	 until,	 lifting	 it carefully	 off,	 her	 fingers	 encountered	 something	 hard,	 heavy	 and	 unyielding between	the	lining	and	the	crown.	After	that	it	didn’t	take	her	long	to	discover

that	the	lining	had	been	ripped	open	and	resewn	with	every	indication	of	careless

haste.	 Human	 curiosity	 did	 the	 rest.	 Within	 a	 very	 few	 minutes	 the	 Cadogan collar	lay	in	her	hands	and	she	was	marvelling	over	it—and	hazily	surmising	the

truth:	Staff	had	been	used	as	a	blind	agent	to	get	the	pearls	into	the	country	duty-free.

Quick	 thoughts	 ran	 riot	 in	 Eleanor’s	 mind.	 Alison	 Landis	 would	 certainly	 not delay	 longer	 than	 a	 few	 hours	 before	 demanding	 her	 hat	 of	 Mr.	 Staff.	 The substitution	would	then	be	discovered	and	she,	Eleanor	Searle,	would	fall	under

suspicion—at	least,	unless	she	took	immediate	steps	to	restore	the	jewels.

She	acted	hastily,	on	impulse.	One	minute	she	was	at	the	telephone,	ordering	a

taxicab,	 the	 next	 she	 was	 hurriedly	 dressing	 herself	 in	 a	 tailor-made	 suit.	 The hour	 was	 late,	 but	 not	 too	 late—although	 (this	 gave	 her	 pause)	 it	 might	 be	 too late	 before	 she	 could	 reach	 Staff’s	 rooms.	 She	 had	 much	 better	 telephone	 him she	was	coming.	Of	course	he	would	have	a	telephone—everybody	has,	in	New

York.

Consultation	 of	 the	 directory	 confirmed	 this	 assumption,	 giving	 her	 both	 his address	 and	 his	 telephone	 number.	 But	 before	 she	 could	 call	 up,	 her	 cab	 was announced.	 Nevertheless	 she	 delayed	 long	 enough	 to	 warn	 him	 hastily	 of	 her coming.	 Then	 she	 snatched	 up	 the	 necklace,	 dropped	 it	 into	 her	 handbag, replaced	the	hat	in	its	bandbox	and	ran	for	the	elevator.

It	 was	 almost	 half-past	 one	 by	 the	 clock	 behind	 the	 desk,	 when	 she	 passed through	the	office.	She	had	really	not	thought	it	so	late.	She	was	conscious	of	the surprised	looks	of	the	clerks	and	pages.	The	porter	at	the	door,	too,	had	a	stare

for	 her	 so	 long	 and	 frank	 as	 to	 approach	 impertinence.	 None	 the	 less	 he	 was quick	enough	to	take	her	bandbox	from	the	bellboy	who	carried	it	and	place	it	in

the	waiting	taxi,	and	handed	her	in	after	it	with	civil	care.	Having	repeated	to	the operator	the	address	she	gave	him,	the	porter	shut	the	door	and	went	back	to	his

post	as	the	vehicle	darted	out	from	the	curb.

Eleanor	knew	little	of	New	York	geography.	Her	previous	visits	to	the	city	had

been	very	few	and	of	short	duration.	With	the	shopping	district	she	was	tolerably

familiar,	and	she	knew	something	of	the	district	roundabout	the	old	Fifth	Avenue

Hotel	 and	 the	 vanished	 Everett	 House.	 But	 with	 these	 exceptions	 she	 was entirely	 ignorant	 of	 the	 lay	 of	 the	 land:	 just	 as	 she	 was	 too	 inexperienced	 to realise	that	it	isn’t	considered	wholly	well-advised	for	a	young	woman	alone	to

take,	in	the	middle	of	the	night,	a	taxicab	whose	chauffeur	carries	a	companion

on	 the	 front	 seat.	 If	 she	 had	 stopped	 to	 consider	 this	 circumstance	 at	 all,	 she would	 have	 felt	 comforted	 by	 the	 presence	 of	 the	 superfluous	 man,	 on	 the general	principle	that	two	protectors	are	better	then	one:	but	the	plain	truth	is	that

she	didn’t	stop	to	consider	it,	her	thoughts	being	fully	engaged	with	what	seemed more	important	matters.

The	 cab	 bounced	 across	 Amsterdam	 Avenue,	 slid	 smoothly	 over	 to	 Columbus, ran	 for	 a	 block	 or	 so	 beneath	 the	 elevated	 structure	 and	 swung	 into	 Seventy-seventh	Street,	through	which	it	pelted	eastward	and	into	Central	Park.	Then	for

some	moments	it	turned	and	twisted	through	the	devious	driveways,	in	a	fashion

so	erratic	that	the	passenger	lost	all	grasp	of	her	whereabouts,	retaining	no	more than	 a	 confused	 impression	 of	 serpentine,	 tree-lined	 ways,	 chequered	 with lamplight	 and	 the	 soft,	 dense	 shadows	 of	 foliage,	 and	 regularly	 spaced	 with staring	electric	arcs.

The	night	had	fallen	black	beneath	an	overcast	sky;	the	air	that	fanned	her	face

was	warm	and	heavy	with	humidity;	what	little	breeze	there	was,	aside	from	that

created	by	the	motion	of	the	cab,	bore	on	its	leaden	wings	the	scent	of	rain.

A	 vague	 uneasiness	 began	 to	 colour	 the	 girl’s	 consciousness.	 She	 grew

increasingly	sensitive	to	the	ominous	quiet	of	the	hour	and	place:	the	stark,	dark stillness	of	the	shrouded	coppices	and	thickets,	the	emptiness	of	the	paths.	Once

only	 she	 caught	 sight	 of	 a	 civilian,	 strolling	 in	 his	 shirt-sleeves,	 coat	 over	 his arm,	 hat	 in	 hand;	 and	 once	 only	 she	 detected,	 at	 a	 distance,	 the	 grey	 of	 a policeman’s	tunic,	half	blotted	out	by	the	shadow	in	which	its	wearer	lounged	at

ease.

And	that	was	far	behind	when,	abruptly,	with	a	grinding	crash	of	brakes,	the	cab

came	 from	 full	 headlong	 tilt	 to	 a	 dead	 halt	 within	 twice	 its	 length.	 She	 pitched forward	from	the	seat	with	a	cry	of	alarm,	only	saving	herself	a	serious	bruising

through	the	instinct	that	led	her	to	thrust	out	her	hands	and	catch	the	frame	of	the forward	windows.

Before	 she	 could	 recover,	 the	 chauffeur’s	 companion	 had	 jumped	 out	 and	 run ahead,	pausing	in	front	of	the	hood	to	stoop	and	stare.	In	another	moment	he	was

back	 with	 a	 report	 couched	 in	 a	 technical	 jargon	 unintelligible	 to	 her

understanding.	She	caught	the	words	“stripped	the	gears”	and	from	them	inferred

the	irremediable.

“What	is	the	matter?”	she	asked	anxiously,	bending	forward.

The	chauffeur	turned	his	head	and	replied	in	a	surly	tone:	“We’ve	broken	down,

ma’m.	You	can’t	go	no	farther	in	this	cab.	I’ll	have	to	get	another	to	tow	us	back to	the	garage.”

“Oh,”	she	cried	in	dismay,	“how	unfortunate!	What	am	I	to	do?”

“Guess	 you’ll	 have	 to	 get	 out	 ’n’	 walk	 back	 to	 Central	 Park	 West,”	 was	 the answer.	 “You	 c’n	 get	 a	 car	 there	 to	 C’lumbus	 Circle.	 You’ll	 find	 a-plenty	 taxis down	there.”

“You’re	quite	sure—”	she	began	to	protest.

“Ah,	they	ain’t	no	chanst	of	this	car	going	another	foot	under	its	own	power—

not	until	it’s	been	a	week	’r	two	in	hospital.	The	only	thing	for	you	to	do	’s	to

hoof	it,	like	I	said.”

“That’s	dead	right,”	averred	the	other	man.	He	was	standing	beside	the	body	of

the	cab	and	now	unlatched	the	door	and	held	it	open	for	her.	“You	might	as	well

get	down,	if	you’re	in	any	great	hurry,	ma’m.”

Eleanor	rose,	eyeing	the	man	distrustfully.	His	accent	wasn’t	that	of	the	kind	of

man	 who	 is	 accustomed	 to	 saying	 “ma’m.”	 His	 back	 was	 toward	 the	 nearest lamp	post,	his	face	in	shadow.	She	gained	no	more	than	a	dim	impression	of	a

short,	slender	figure	masked	in	a	grey	duster	buttoned	to	the	throat,	and,	above	it, a	face	rendered	indefinite	by	a	short,	pointed	beard	and	a	grey	motor-cap	pulled

well	down	over	the	eyes....

But	there	was	nothing	to	do	but	accept	the	situation.	An	accident	was	an	accident

—unpleasant	but	irreparable.	There	was	no	alternative;	she	could	do	nothing	but

adopt	 the	 chauffeur’s	 suggestion.	 She	 stepped	 out,	 turning	 back	 to	 get	 her bandbox.

“Beg	pardon,	ma’m.	I’ll	get	that	for	you.”

The	man	by	the	door	interposed	an	arm	between	Eleanor	and	the	bandbox.

She	said,	“Oh	no!”	and	attempted	to	push	past	his	arm.

Immediately	he	caught	her	by	the	shoulder	and	thrust	her	away	with	staggering

violence.	She	reeled	back	half	a	dozen	feet.	Simultaneously	she	heard	the	fellow

say,	 sharply:	 “All	 right—go	 ahead!”	 and	 saw	 him	 jump	 upon	 the	 step.	 On	 the instant,	 the	 cab	 shot	 away	 through	 the	 shadows,	 the	 door	 swinging	 wide	 while Eleanor’s	assailant	scrambled	into	the	body.

Before	 she	 could	 collect	 herself	 the	 car	 had	 disappeared	 round	 a	 curve	 in	 the roadway.

Her	natural	impulse	was	to	scream,	to	start	a	hue-and-cry:	“Stop	thief!”	But	the strong	 element	 of	 common-sense	 in	 her	 make-up	 counselled	 her	 to	 hold	 her tongue.	 In	 a	 trice	 she	 comprehended	 precisely	 the	 meaning	 of	 the	 passage.

Somebody	else—somebody	aside	from	herself,	Staff	and	Alison	Landis—knew

the	 secret	 of	 the	 bandbox	 and	 the	 smuggled	 necklace,	 and	 with	 astonishing intuition	 had	 planned	 this	 trap	 to	 gain	 possession	 of	 it.	 She	 was	 amazed	 to contemplate	the	penetrating	powers	of	inference	and	deduction,	the	cunning	and

resource	 which	 had	 not	 only	 in	 so	 short	 a	 time	 fathomed	 the	 mystery	 of	 the vanished	 necklace,	 but	 had	 discovered	 the	 exchange	 of	 bandboxes,	 had	 traced the	right	one	to	her	hotel	and	possession,	had	divined	and	taken	advantage	of	her

impulse	 to	 return	 the	 property	 to	 its	 rightful	 owner	 without	 an	 instant’s	 loss	 of time.	And	with	this	thought	came	another,	more	alarming:	in	a	brace	of	minutes

the	 thieves	 would	 discover	 that	 the	 necklace	 had	 been	 abstracted	 from	 the	 hat and—men	 of	 such	 boldness	 wouldn’t	 hesitate	 about	 turning	 back	 to	 run	 her down	and	take	their	booty	by	force.

It	 was	 this	 consideration	 that	 bade	 her	 refrain	 from	 crying	 out.	 Conceivably,	 if she	 did	 raise	 an	 alarm,	 help	 might	 be	 longer	 in	 coming	 than	 the	 taxicab	 in returning.	They	had	the	hat	and	bandbox,	and	were	welcome	to	them,	for	all	of

her,	as	long	as	she	retained	the	real	valuables.	Her	only	chance	lay	in	instant	and secret	flight,	in	hiding	herself	away	in	the	gloomy	fastnesses	of	these	unknown

pleasure-grounds,	so	securely	that	they	might	not	find	her.

She	 stood	 alone	 in	 the	 middle	 of	 a	 broad	 road.	 There	 was	 nobody	 in	 sight, whichever	way	she	looked.	On	one	hand	a	wide	asphalt	path	ran	parallel	with	the

drive;	 on	 the	 other	 lay	 a	 darksome	 hedge	 of	 trees	 and	 shrubbery.	 She	 hesitated not	two	seconds	over	her	choice,	and	in	a	third	was	struggling	and	forcing	a	way

through	 the	 undergrowth	 and	 beneath	 the	 low	 and	 spreading	 branches	 whose shadows	cloaked	her	with	a	friendly	curtain	of	blackness.

Beyond—she	 was	 not	 long	 in	 winning	 through—lay	 a	 broad	 meadow,

glimmering	faintly	in	the	glow	of	light	reflected	from	the	bosoms	of	low,	slow-

moving	 clouds.	 A	 line	 of	 trees	 bordered	 it	 at	 a	 considerable	 distance;	 beneath them	were	visible	patches	of	asphalt	walk,	shining	coldly	under	electric	arcs.

Having	absolutely	no	notion	whatever	of	where	she	was	in	the	Park,	after	some

little	 hesitation	 she	 decided	 against	 attempting	 to	 cross	 the	 lawn	 and	 turned instead,	at	random,	to	her	right,	stumbling	away	in	the	kindly	penumbra	of	trees.

She	 thanked	 her	 stars	 that	 she	 had	 chosen	 to	 wear	 this	 dark,	 short-skirted	 suit

that	gave	her	so	much	freedom	of	action	and	at	the	same	time	blended	so	well with	the	shadows	wherein	she	must	skulk....

Before	 many	 minutes	 she	 received	 confirmation	 of	 her	 fears	 in	 the	 drone	 of	 a distant	 motor	 humming	 in	 the	 stillness	 and	 gaining	 volume	 with	 every	 beat	 of her	 heart.	 Presently	 it	 was	 strident	 and	 near	 at	 hand;	 and	 then,	 standing	 like	 a frozen	 thing,	 not	 daring	 to	 stir	 (indeed,	 half	 petrified	 with	 fear)	 she	 saw	 the marauding	taxicab	wheel	slowly	past,	the	chauffeur	scrutinising	one	side	of	the

way,	 the	 man	 in	 the	 grey	 duster	 standing	 up	 in	 the	 body	 and	 holding	 the	 door half	open,	while	he	raked	with	sweeping	glances	the	coppice	wherein	she	stood

hiding.

But	it	did	not	stop.	Incredible	though	it	seemed,	she	was	not	detected.	Obviously

the	men	were	at	a	loss,	unable	to	surmise	which	one	she	had	chosen	of	a	dozen

ways	of	escape.	The	taxicab	drilled	on	at	a	snail’s	pace	for	some	distance	up	the

drive,	then	swung	round	and	came	back	at	a	good	speed.	As	it	passed	her	for	the

second	time	she	could	hear	one	of	its	crew	swearing	angrily.

Again	the	song	of	the	motor	died	in	the	distance,	and	again	she	found	courage	to

move.	 But	 which	 way?	 How	 soonest	 to	 win	 out	 of	 this	 strange,	 bewildering maze	 of	 drives	 and	 paths,	 crossing	 and	 recrossing,	 melting	 together	 and

diverging	without	apparent	motive	or	design?

She	advanced	to	the	edge	of	the	drive,	paused,	listening	with	every	faculty	alert.

There	was	no	sound	but	the	muted	soughing	of	the	night	wind	in	the	trees—not	a

footfall,	not	the	clap	of	a	hoof	or	the	echo	of	a	motor’s	whine.	She	moved	on	a

yard	or	two,	and	found	herself	suddenly	in	the	harsh	glare	of	an	arc-lamp.	This

decided	 her;	 she	 might	 as	 well	 go	 forward	 as	 retreat,	 now	 that	 she	 had	 shown herself.	She	darted	at	a	run	across	the	road	and	gained	the	paved	path,	paused	an

instant,	heard	nothing,	and	ran	on	until	forced	to	stop	for	breath.

And	still	no	sign	of	pursuit!	She	began	to	feel	a	little	reassured,	and	after	a	brief rest	went	on	aimlessly,	with	the	single	intention	of	sticking	to	one	walk	as	far	as it	might	lead	her,	in	the	hope	that	it	might	lead	her	to	the	outskirts	of	the	Park.

Vain	 hope!	 Within	 a	 short	 time	 she	 found	 herself	 scrambling	 over	 bare	 rocks, with	shrubbery	on	either	hand	and	a	looming	mass	of	masonry	stencilled	against

the	 sky	 ahead.	 This	 surely	 could	 not	 be	 the	 way.	 She	 turned	 back,	 lost	 herself, half	stumbled	and	half	fell	down	a	sharp	slope,	plodded	across	another	lawn	and

found	 another	 path,	 which	 led	 her	 northwards	 (though	 she	 had	 no	 means	 of knowing	 this).	 In	 time	 it	 crossed	 one	 of	 the	 main	 drives,	 then	 recrossed.	 She

followed	it	with	patient	persistence,	hoping,	but	desperately	weary.

Now	and	again	she	passed	benches	upon	which	men	sprawled	in	crude,	uneasy

attitudes,	as	a	rule	snoring	noisily.	She	dared	not	ask	her	way	of	these.	Once	one roused	 to	 the	 sharp	 tapping	 of	 her	 heels,	 stared	 insolently	 and,	 as	 she	 passed, spoke	 to	 her	 in	 a	 thick,	 rough	 voice.	 She	 did	 not	 understand	 what	 he	 said,	 but quickened	her	pace	and	held	on	bravely,	with	her	head	high	and	her	heart	in	her

mouth.	Mercifully,	she	was	not	followed.

Again—and	 not	 once	 but	 a	 number	 of	 times—the	 sound	 of	 a	 motor	 drove	 her from	 the	 path	 to	 the	 safe	 obscurity	 of	 the	 trees	 and	 undergrowth.	 But	 in	 every such	 instance	 her	 apprehensions	 were	 without	 foundation;	 the	 machines	 were mostly	touring-cars	or	limousines	beating	homeward	from	some	late	festivity.

And	 twice	 she	 thought	 to	 descry	 at	 a	 distance	 the	 grey-coated	 figure	 of	 a policeman;	but	each	time,	when	she	had	gained	the	spot,	the	man	had	vanished

—or	else	some	phenomenon	of	light	and	shadow	had	misled	her.

Minutes,	 in	 themselves	 seemingly	 endless,	 ran	 into	 hours	 while	 she	 wandered (so	 heavy	 with	 fatigue	 that	 she	 found	 herself	 wondering	 how	 it	 was	 that	 she didn’t	 collapse	 from	 sheer	 exhaustion	 on	 any	 one	 of	 the	 interminable	 array	 of benches	 that	 she	 passed)	 dragging	 her	 leaden	 feet	 and	 aching	 limbs	 and

struggling	to	hold	up	her	hot	and	throbbing	head.

It	was	long	after	three	when	finally	she	emerged	at	One-hundred-and-tenth	Street

and	 Lenox	 Avenue.	 And	 here	 fortune	 proved	 more	 kind:	 she	 blundered	 blindly almost	 into	 the	 arms	 of	 a	 policeman,	 stumbled	 through	 her	 brief	 story	 and dragged	wearily	on	his	arm	over	to	Central	Park	West.	Here	he	put	her	aboard	a

southbound	Eighth	Avenue	surface-car,	instructing	the	conductor	where	she	was

to	get	off	and	then	presumably	used	the	telephone	on	his	beat	to	such	effect	that

she	was	met	on	alighting	by	another	man	in	uniform	who	escorted	her	to	the	St.

Simon.	She	was	too	tired,	too	thoroughly	worn	out,	to	ask	him	how	it	happened

that	 he	 was	 waiting	 for	 her,	 or	 even	 to	 do	 more	 than	 give	 him	 a	 bare	 word	 of thanks.	As	for	complaining	of	her	adventure	to	the	night-clerk	(who	stared	as	she

passed	through	to	the	elevator)	no	imaginable	consideration	could	have	induced

her	to	stop	for	any	such	purpose.

But	one	thing	was	clear	to	her	intelligence,	to	be	attended	to	before	she	toppled

over	 on	 her	 bed:	 Staff	 must	 be	 warned	 by	 telephone	 of	 the	 attempt	 to	 steal	 the necklace	and	the	reason	why	she	had	not	been	able	to	reach	his	residence.	And	if

this	were	to	be	accomplished,	she	must	do	it	before	she	dared	sit	down.

In	 conformance	 with	 this	 fixed	 idea,	 she	 turned	 directly	 to	 the	 telephone	 after closing	the	door	of	her	room—pausing	neither	to	strip	off	her	gloves	and	remove

her	 hat	 nor	 even	 to	 relieve	 her	 aching	 wrist	 of	 the	 handbag	 which,	 with	 its precious	contents,	dangled	on	its	silken	thong.

She	 had	 to	 refresh	 her	 memory	 with	 a	 consultation	 of	 the	 directory	 before	 she could	ask	for	Staff’s	number.

The	switchboard	operator	was	slow	to	answer;	and	when	he	did,	there	followed

one	of	those	exasperating	delays,	apparently	so	inexcusable....

Fascinated,	dumb	with	terror,	she	watched

Fascinated,	dumb	with	terror,	she	watched

Page	193

She	 experienced	 a	 sensation	 of	 faintness	 and	 dizziness;	 her	 limbs	 were

trembling;	she	felt	as	though	sleep	were	overcoming	her	as	she	stood;	but	a	little more	and	she	had	strained	endurance	to	the	breaking-point....

At	length	the	connection	was	made.	Staff’s	agitated	voice	seemed	drawn	thin	by

an	 immense	 distance.	 By	 a	 supreme	 effort	 she	 managed	 to	 spur	 her	 flagging faculties	and	began	to	falter	her	incredible	story,	but	had	barely	swung	into	the

second	 sentence	 when	 her	 voice	 died	 in	 her	 throat	 and	 her	 tongue	 clave	 to	 the roof	of	her	mouth.

The	telephone	instrument	was	fixed	to	the	wall	near	the	clothes-closet,	the	door

of	which	framed	a	long	mirror.	This	door,	standing	slightly	ajar,	reflected	to	her vision	the	hall	door.

She	had	detected	a	movement	in	the	mirror.	The	hall	door	was	opening—slowly,

gently,	noiselessly,	inch	by	inch.	Fascinated,	dumb	with	terror,	she	watched.	She

saw	the	hand	that	held	the	knob—a	small	hand,	thin	and	fragile;	then	the	wrist,

then	part	of	the	arm....	A	head	appeared	in	the	opening,	curiously	suggesting	the

head	of	a	bird,	thinly	thatched	with	hair	of	a	faded	yellow;	out	of	its	face,	small eyes	watched	her,	steadfastly	inquisitive.

Almost	 mechanically	 she	 replaced	 the	 receiver	 on	 the	 hook	 and	 turned	 away from	the	wall,	stretching	forth	her	hands	in	a	gesture	of	pitiful	supplication....





XI

THE	COLD	GREY	DAWN

“Well?”	snapped	Iff	irritably.	“What’re	you	staring	at?”

“You,”	Staff	replied	calmly.	“I	was	thinking—”

“About	me?	What?”

“Merely	that	you	are	apparently	as	much	cut	up	as	if	the	necklace	were	yours—

as	 if	 you	 were	 in	 danger	 of	 being	 robbed,	 instead	 of	 Miss	 Landis—by	 way	 of Miss	Searle.”

“And	I	am!”	asserted	Iff	vigorously.	“I	am,	damn	it!	I’m	in	no	danger	of	losing

any	 necklace;	 but	 if	 he	 gets	 away	 with	 the	 goods,	 that	 infernal	 scoundrel	 will manage	some	way	to	implicate	me	and	rob	me	of	my	good	name	and	my	liberty

as	well.	Hell!”	he	exploded—“seems	to	me	I’m	entitled	to	be	excited!”

Staff’s	unspoken	comment	was	that	this	explanation	of	the	little	man’s	agitation

was	 something	 strained	 and	 inconclusive:	 unsatisfactory	 at	 best.	 It	 was	 not apparent	 how	 (even	 assuming	 the	 historical	 Mr.	 Ismay	 to	 be	 at	 that	 moment stealing	 the	 Cadogan	 collar	 from	 Miss	 Searle)	 the	 crime	 could	 be	 fastened	 on Mr.	 Iff,	 in	 the	 face	 of	 the	 positive	 alibi	 Staff	 could	 furnish	 him.	 On	 the	 other hand,	it	was	indubitable	that	Iff	believed	himself	endangered	in	some	mysterious

way,	 or	 had	 some	 other	 and	 still	 more	 secret	 cause	 for	 disquiet.	 For	 his uneasiness	 was	 so	 manifest,	 in	 such	 sharp	 contrast	 with	 his	 habitual,	 semi-cynical	repose,	that	even	he	hadn’t	attempted	to	deny	it.

With	a	shrug	Staff	turned	back	to	the	telephone	and	asked	for	the	manager	of	the

exchange,	explained	his	predicament	and	was	promised	that,	if	the	call	could	be

traced	back	to	the	original	station,	he	should	have	the	number.	He	was,	however,

counselled	to	be	patient.	Such	a	search	would	take	time,	quite	possibly	and	very

probably.

He	explained	this	to	Iff,	whose	disgust	was	ill-disguised.

“And	 meanwhile,”	 he	 expostulated,	 “we’re	 sitting	 here	 with	 our	 hands	 in	 our laps—useless—and	Ismay,	as	like	’s	not,	is—”	He	broke	into	profanity,	trotting

up	and	down	and	twisting	his	small	hands	together.

“I	 wish,”	 said	 Staff,	 “I	 knew	 what	 makes	 you	 act	 this	 way.	 Ismay	 can’t	 saddle you	with	a	crime	committed	by	him	when	you’re	in	my	company—”

“You	don’t	know	him,”	interpolated	Iff.

“And	you	surely	can’t	be	stirred	so	deeply	by	simple	solicitude	for	Miss	Searle.”

“Oh,	 can’t	 I?	 And	 how	 do	 you	 know	 I	 can’t?”	 barked	 the	 little	 man.	 “Gwan—

leave	me	alone!	I	want	to	think.”

“Best	wishes,”	Staff	told	him	pleasantly.	“I’m	going	to	change	my	clothes.”

“Symptoms	of	intelligence,”	grunted	Iff.	“I	was	wondering	when	you’d	wake	up

to	the	incongruity	of	knight-erranting	it	after	damsels	in	distress	in	an	open-faced get-up	like	that.”

“It’s	 done,	 however,”	 argued	 Staff	 good-humouredly.	 “It’s	 class,	 if	 the

illustrators	 are	 to	 be	 believed.	 Don’t	 you	 ever	 read	 modern	 fiction?	 In emergencies	like	these	the	hero	always	takes	a	cold	bath	and	changes	his	clothes

before	 sallying	 forth	 to	 put	 a	 crimp	 in	 the	 villain’s	 plans.	 Just	 the	 same	 as	 me.

Only	I’m	going	to	shed	evening	dress	instead	of—”

“Good	heavens,	man!”	snorted	Iff.	“Are	you	in	training	for	a	monologist’s	job?

If	so—if	not—anyway—can	it!	Can	the	extemporaneous	stuff!”

The	telephone	bell	silenced	whatever	retort	Staff	may	have	contemplated.	Both

men	jumped	for	the	desk,	but	Staff	got	there	first.

“Hello?”	he	cried,	receiver	at	ear.	“Yes?	Hello?”

But	instead	of	the	masculine	accents	of	the	exchange-manager	he	heard,	for	the

third	time	that	night,	the	voice	of	Miss	Searle.

“Yes,”	he	replied	almost	breathlessly—“it	is	I,	Miss	Searle.	Thank	Heaven	you

called	up!	I’ve	been	worrying	silly—”

“We	were	cut	off,”	the	girl’s	voice	responded.	He	noted,	subconsciously,	that	she

was	speaking	slowly	and	carefully,	as	if	with	effort....	“Cut	off,”	she	repeated	as by	rote,	“and	I	had	trouble	getting	you	again.”

“Then	you’re—you’re	all	right?”

“Quite,	 thank	 you.	 I	 had	 an	 unpleasant	 experience	 trying	 to	 get	 to	 you	 by taxicab.	The	motor	broke	down	coming	through	Central	Park,	and	I	had	to	walk

home	and	lost	my	way.	But	I	am	all	right	now—just	tired	out.”

“I’m	 sorry,”	 he	 said	 sincerely.	 “It’s	 too	 bad;	 I	 was	 quite	 ready	 to	 call	 for	 the—

you	 understand—and	 save	 you	 the	 trouble	 of	 the	 trip	 down	 here.	 But	 I’m	 glad you’ve	had	no	more	unpleasant	adventure.”

“The	necklace	is	safe,”	the	girl’s	voice	told	him	with	the	same	deadly	precision

of	utterance.

“Oh,	yes;	I	assumed	that.	And	I	may	call	for	it?”

“If	 you	 please—today	 at	 noon.	 I	 am	 so	 tired	 I	 am	 afraid	 I	 shan’t	 get	 up	 before noon.”

“That’ll	be	quite	convenient	to	me,	thank	you,”	he	assured	her.	“But	where	are

you	stopping?”

There	fell	a	brief	pause.	Then	she	said	something	indistinguishable.

“Yes?”	 he	 said.	 “Beg	 pardon—I	 didn’t	 get	 that.	 A	 little	 louder	 please,	 Miss Searle.”

“The	St.	Regis.”

“Where?”	he	repeated	in	surprise.

“The	 St.	 Regis.	 I	 am	 here	 with	 Mrs.	 Ilkington—her	 guest.	 Good	 night,	 Mr.

Staff.”

“Good	morning,”	he	laughed;	and	at	once	the	connection	was	severed.

“And	that’s	all	right!”	he	announced	cheerfully,	swinging	round	to	face	Iff.	“She

was	 in	 a	 taxicab	 accident	 and	 got	 lost	 in	 Central	 Park—just	 got	 home,	 I	 infer.

The	necklace	is	safe	and	I’m	to	call	and	get	it	at	twelve	o’clock.”

“Where’s	 she	 stopping?”	 demanded	 Iff,	 shaking	 his	 little	 head	 as	 though

impatient.	Staff	named	the	hotel,	and	Iff	fairly	jumped.	“Why	that’s	impossible!”

he	cried.	“She	can’t	afford	it.”

“How	do	you	happen	to	know	she	can’t?”	enquired	Staff,	perplexed.

Momentarily	 Iff	 showed	 a	 face	 of	 confusion.	 “I	 know	 a	 lot	 of	 things,”	 he

grumbled,	evasively.

Staff	 waited	 a	 moment,	 then	 finding	 that	 the	 little	 man	 didn’t	 purpose	 making any	more	adequate	or	satisfactory	explanation,	observed:	“It	happens	that	she’s

Mrs.	 Ilkington’s	 guest,	 and	 I	 fancy	 Mrs.	 Ilkington	 can	 afford	 it—unless	 you know	more	about	her,	too,	than	I	do.”

Iff	 shook	 his	 head,	 dissatisfied.	 “All	 right,”	 he	 said	 wearily.	 “Now	 what’re	 you going	to	do?”

“I’m	 going	 to	 try	 to	 snatch	 a	 few	 hours’	 sleep.	 There’s	 no	 reason	 why	 I shouldn’t,	now,	with	nothing	to	do	before	noon.”

“Pleasant	dreams,”	said	Iff	sourly,	as	Staff	marched	off	to	his	bedroom.

Then	 he	 sat	 down	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 divan,	 hugging	 the	 dressing-gown	 round him,	 scowled	 vindictively	 at	 nothing	 and	 began	 thoughtfully	 to	 gnaw	 a	 bony knuckle.

In	the	other	room,	his	host	was	undressing	with	surprising	speed.	In	spite	of	his

nap,	 he	 was	 still	 tremendously	 tired;	 perhaps	 the	 reaction	 caused	 by	 Eleanor’s reassurance	capping	the	climax	of	his	excitement	had	something	to	do	with	the

sense	of	complete	mental	and	physical	fatigue	that	swept	over	him	the	instant	his

back	rested	upon	the	bed.	Within	two	minutes	he	was	fast	asleep.

But	 in	 the	 study	 Mr.	 Iff	 kept	 vigil,	 biting	 his	 knuckles	 what	 time	 he	 was	 not depleting	his	host’s	stock	of	cigarettes.

Daylight	broadened	over	the	city.	The	sun	rose.	Not	to	be	outdone,	so	did	Mr.	Iff

—moving	quietly	round	the	room,	swearing	beneath	his	breath	as	his	conscience

dictated,	gradually	accumulating	more	and	more	of	the	articles	of	clothing	which

he	had	so	disdainfully	discarded	some	hours	earlier.

The	 telephone	 interrupted	 him	 somewhat	 after	 six	 o’clock.	 He	 answered	 it, assuming	Staff’s	identity	for	the	moment.	When	the	conversation	had	closed,	he

sat	 in	 reverie	 for	 some	 minutes,	 then	 consulted	 the	 telephone	 book	 and	 called two	 numbers	 in	 quick	 succession.	 Immediately	 thereafter	 he	 tiptoed	 into	 the bedroom,	assured	himself	that	Staff	was	fast	asleep	and	proceeded	calmly	to	rifle

that	 gentleman’s	 pockets,	 carefully	 placing	 what	 he	 found	 in	 an	 orderly	 array upon	the	bureau.	In	the	end,	bringing	to	light	a	plump	bill-fold,	he	concluded	his investigations.

The	pigskin	envelope	contained	a	little	less	than	four-hundred	dollars,	mostly	in gold	 Treasury	 certificates.	 Mr.	 Iff	 helped	 himself	 generously	 and	 replaced	 the bill-fold.	Then	he	returned	to	the	study,	found	paper	and	pens	and	wrote	Staff	a

little	note,	which	he	propped	against	the	mirror	on	the	bedroom	dresser.	Finally,

filling	one	of	his	pockets	with	cigarettes,	he	smiled	blandly	and	let	himself	out	of the	apartment	and,	subsequently,	of	the	house.

Staff	slept	on,	sublimely	unconscious,	until	the	sun,	slipping	round	to	the	south, splashed	 his	 face	 with	 moulten	 gold:	 when	 he	 woke,	 fretful	 and	 sweatful.	 He glanced	 at	 his	 watch	 and	 got	 up	 promptly:	 the	 hour	 approached	 eleven.	 Diving into	a	bathrobe,	he	turned	the	water	on	for	his	bath,	trotted	to	the	front	room	and discovered	the	evasion	of	Mr.	Iff.	This,	however,	failed	to	surprise	him.	Iff	was, after	all,	not	bound	to	sit	tight	until	Staff	gave	him	leave	to	stir.

He	 rang	 for	 Mrs.	 Shultz	 and	 ordered	 breakfast.	 Then	 he	 bathed	 and	 began	 to dress.	It	was	during	this	latter	ceremony	that	he	found	his	pockets	turned	inside

out	and	their	contents	displayed	upon	his	bureau.

This	 was	 a	 shock,	 especially	 when	 he	 failed	 to	 find	 his	 bill-fold	 at	 the	 first sweep.	The	bottom	dropped	out	of	the	market	for	confidence	in	the	integrity	of

Mr.	Iff	and	conceit	in	the	perspicacity	of	Mr.	Staff.	He	saw	instantly	how	flimsy

had	been	the	tissue	of	falsehood	wherewith	the	 soi-disant	Mr.	Iff	had	sought	 to cloak	 his	 duplicity,	 how	 egregiously	 stupid	 had	 been	 his	 readiness	 to	 swallow that	 extraordinary	 yarn.	 The	 more	 he	 considered,	 the	 more	 he	 marvelled.	 It surpassed	belief—his	asininity	did;	at	least	 he	wouldn’t	have	believed	he	could be	 so	 easily	 fooled.	 He	 felt	 like	 kicking	 himself—and	 longed	 unutterably	 for	 a chance	to	kick	his	erstwhile	guest.

In	 the	 midst	 of	 this	 transport	 he	 found	 himself	 staring	 incredulously	 at	 the envelope	on	the	dresser.	He	snatched	it	up,	tore	it	open	and	removed	three	pieces

of	white	paper.	Two	of	them	were	crisp	and	tough	and	engraved	on	one	side	with

jet-black	ink.	The	third	bore	this	communication:

“MY	DEAR	MR.	STAFF:—Your	bill-fold’s	in	your	waistcoat	pocket,	where	you

left	it	last	night.	It	contained	$385	when	I	found	it.	It	now	contains	$200.	I

leave	 you	 by	 way	 of	 security	 Bank	 of	 England	 notes	 to	 the	 extent	 of	 £40.

There’ll	 be	 a	 bit	 of	 change,	 one	 way	 or	 the	 other—I’m	 too	 hurried	 to

calculate	which.

“The	 exchange	 manager	 has	 just	 called	 up.	 The	 interrupted	 call	 has	 been traced	back	to	the	Hotel	St.	Simon	in	79th	Street,	W.	I	have	called	the	St.

Regis;	 neither	 Miss	 Searle	 nor	 Mrs.	 Ilkington	 has	 registered	 there.	 I	 have also	 called	 the	 St.	 Simon;	 both	 ladies	 are	 there.	 Your	 hearing	 must	 be defective—or	else	Miss	S.	didn’t	know	where	she	was	at.

“I’m	 off	 to	 line	 my	 inwards	 with	 food	 and	 decorate	 my	 outwards	 with

purple	 and	 fine	 underlinen.	 After	 which	 I	 purpose	 minding	 my	 own

business	for	a	few	hours	or	days,	as	the	circumstances	may	demand.	But	do

not	grieve—I	shall	return	eftsoons	or	thereabouts.

“Yours	in	the	interests	of	pure	crime—

“WHIFF.

“P.	 S.—And	 of	 course	 neither	 of	 us	 had	 the	 sense	 to	 ask:	 If	 Miss	 S.	 was bound	here	from	the	St.	Regis,	how	did	her	taxi	manage	to	break	down	in

Central	Park?”

Prompt	 investigation	 revealed	 the	 truth	 of	 Mr.	 Iff’s	 assertion:	 the	 bill-fold	 with its	 remaining	 two-hundred	 dollars	 was	 safely	 tucked	 away	 in	 the	 waistcoat pocket.	Furthermore,	the	two	twenty-pound	notes	were	unquestionably	genuine.

The	tide	of	Staff’s	faith	in	human	nature	began	again	to	flood;	the	flower	of	his

self-conceit	 flourished	 amazingly.	 He	 surmised	 that	 he	 wasn’t	 such	 a	 bad	 little judge	of	mankind,	after	all.

He	breakfasted	with	a	famous	appetite,	untroubled	by	Iff’s	aspersion	on	his	sense

of	hearing,	which	was	excellent;	and	he	had	certainly	heard	Miss	Searle	aright:

she	had	named	the	St.	Regis	not	once,	but	twice,	and	each	time	with	the	clearest

enunciation.	 He	 could	 only	 attribute	 the	 mistake	 to	 her	 excitement	 and	 fatigue; people	frequently	make	such	mistakes	under	unusual	conditions;	if	Miss	Searle

had	 wished	 to	 deceive	 him	 as	 to	 her	 whereabouts,	 she	 needed	 only	 to	 refrain from	communicating	with	him	at	all.	And	anyway,	he	knew	now	where	to	find

her	 and	 within	 the	 hour	 would	 have	 found	 her;	 and	 then	 everything	 would	 be cleared	up.

He	 was	 mildly	 surprised	 at	 the	 sense	 of	 pleasant	 satisfaction	 with	 which	 he looked	 forward	 to	 meeting	 the	 girl	 again.	 He	 reminded	 himself	 not	 to	 forget	 to interview	a	manager	or	two	in	her	interests.

Just	to	make	assurance	doubly	sure,	he	telephoned	the	St.	Simon	while	waiting

for	 Shultz	 to	 fetch	 a	 taxicab.	 The	 switchboard	 operator	 at	 that	 establishment replied	in	the	affirmative	to	his	enquiry	as	to	whether	or	not	Mrs.	Ilkington	and

Miss	Searle	were	registered	there.

On	the	top	of	this	he	was	called	up	by	Alison.

“I’m	just	starting	out—cab	waiting,”	he	told	her	at	once—“to	go	to	Miss	Searle

and	get	your—property.”

“Oh,	you	are?”	she	returned	in	what	he	thought	a	singular	tone.

“Yes;	she	called	me	up	last	night—said	she’d	discovered	the	mistake	and	the—

ah—property—asked	me	to	call	today	at	noon.”

There	was	no	necessity	that	he	could	see	of	detailing	the	whole	long	story	over	a

telephone	wire.

“Well,”	 said	 Alison	 after	 a	 little	 pause,	 “I	 don’t	 want	 to	 interfere	 with	 your amusements,	 but	 ...	 I’ve	 something	 very	 particular	 to	 say	 to	 you.	 I	 wish	 you’d stop	here	on	your	way	uptown.”

“Why,	certainly,”	he	agreed	without	hesitation	or	apprehension.

The	actress	had	put	up,	in	accordance	with	her	custom,	at	a	handsome,	expensive

and	 world-famous	 hotel	 in	 the	 immediate	 neighbourhood	 of	 Staff’s	 rooms.

Consequently	he	found	himself	in	her	presence	within	fifteen	minutes	from	the

end	of	their	talk	by	telephone.

Dressed	for	the	street	and	looking	uncommonly	handsome,	she	was	waiting	for

him	in	the	sitting-room	of	her	suite.	As	he	entered,	she	came	forward	and	gave

him	 a	 cool	 little	 hand	 and	 a	 greeting	 as	 cool.	 He	 received	 both	 with	 an imperturbability	 founded	 (he	 discovered	 to	 his	 great	 surprise)	 on	 solid

indifference.	It	was	hard	to	realise	that	he	no	longer	cared	for	her,	or	whether	she were	 pleased	 or	 displeased	 with	 him.	 But	 he	 didn’t.	 He	 concluded,	 not	 without profound	 amazement,	 that	 his	 passion	 for	 her	 which	 had	 burned	 so	 long	 and brightly	 had	 been	 no	 more	 than	 sentimental	 incandescence.	 And	 he	 began	 to think	 himself	 a	 very	 devil	 of	 a	 fellow,	 who	 could	 toy	 with	 the	 love	 of	 women with	such	complete	insouciance,	who	could	off	with	the	old	love	before	he	had

found	a	new	and	care	not	a	rap!...

Throughout	 this	 self-analysis	 he	 was	 mouthing	 commonplaces—assuring	 her

that	 the	 day	 was	 fine,	 that	 he	 had	 never	 felt	 better,	 that	 she	 was	 looking	 her charming	 best.	 Of	 a	 sudden	 his	 vision	 comprehended	 an	 article	 which	 adorned the	centre-table;	and	words	forsook	him	and	his	jaw	dropped.

It	 was	 the	 bandbox:	 not	 that	 which	 he	 had	 left,	 with	 its	 cargo	 of	 trash,	 in	 his

rooms.

Alison	 followed	 his	 glance,	 elevated	 her	 brows,	 and	 indicated	 the	 box	 with	 a wave	of	her	arm.

“And	what	d’	you	know	about	that?”	she	enquired	bluntly.

“Where	did	it	come	from?”	he	counter-questioned,	all	agape.

“I’m	asking	you.”

“But—I	know	nothing	about	it.	Did	Miss	Searle	send	it—?”

“I	can’t	say,”	replied	the	actress	drily.	“Your	name	on	the	tag	has	been	scratched out	and	mine,	with	this	address,	written	above	it.”

Staff	 moved	 over	 to	 the	 table	 and	 while	 he	 was	 intently	 scrutinising	 the	 tag, Alison	continued:

“It	 came	 by	 messenger	 about	 eight	 this	 morning;	 Jane	 brought	 it	 to	 me	 when	 I got	up	a	little	while	ago.”

“The	hat	was	in	it?”	he	asked.

She	nodded	impatiently:	“Oh,	of	course—with	the	lining	half	ripped	out	and	the

necklace	missing.”

“Curious!”	he	murmured.

“Rather,”	she	agreed.	“What	do	you	make	of	it?”

“This	address	isn’t	her	writing,”	he	said,	deep	in	thought.

“Oh,	so	you’re	familiar	with	the	lady’s	hand?”	There	was	an	accent	in	Alison’s

voice	that	told	him,	before	he	looked,	that	her	lip	was	curling	and	her	eyes	were

hard.

“This	is	a	man’s	writing,”	he	said	quietly,	wondering	if	it	could	be	possible	that Alison	was	jealous.

“Well?”	she	demanded.	“What	of	it?”

“I	don’t	know.	Miss	Searle	got	me	on	the	telephone	a	little	after	one	last	night;

she	said	she’d	found	the	necklace	in	the	hat	and	was	bringing	it	to	me.”

“How	did	she	know	it	was	mine?”

“Heard	you	order	it	sent	to	me,	in	London.	You’ll	remember	my	telling	you	she

knew.”

“Oh,	yes.	Go	on.”

“She	 didn’t	 show	 up,	 but	 telephoned	 again	 some	 time	 round	 four	 o’clock

explaining	that	she	had	been	in	a	taxicab	accident	in	the	Park	and	lost	her	way

but	finally	got	home—that	is,	to	her	hotel,	the	St.	Simon.	She	said	the	necklace

was	 safe—didn’t	 mention	 the	 hat—and	 asked	 me	 to	 call	 for	 it	 at	 noon	 today.	 I said	I	would,	and	I’m	by	way	of	being	late	now.	Doubtless	she	can	explain	how

the	hat	came	to	you	this	way.”

“I’ll	be	interested	to	hear,”	said	Alison,	“and	to	know	that	the	necklace	is	really safe.	 On	 the	 face	 of	 it—as	 it	 stands—there’s	 something	 queer—wrong....	 What are	you	going	to	do?”

Staff	had	moved	toward	the	telephone.	He	paused,	explaining	that	he	was	about

to	call	up	Miss	Searle	for	reassurance.	Alison	negatived	this	instantly.

“Why	waste	time?	If	she	has	the	thing,	the	quickest	way	to	get	it	is	to	go	to	her

now—at	once.	If	she	hasn’t,	the	quickest	way	to	get	after	it	is	via	the	same	route.

I’m	all	ready	and	if	you	are	we’ll	go	immediately.”

Staff	 bowed,	 displeased	 with	 her	 manner	 to	 the	 point	 of	 silence.	 He	 had	 no objection	to	her	being	as	temperamental	as	she	pleased,	but	he	objected	strongly

to	having	it	implied	by	everything	except	spoken	words	that	he	was	in	some	way

responsible	 for	 the	 necklace	 and	 that	 Eleanor	 Searle	 was	 quite	 capable	 of conspiring	to	steal	it.

As	for	Alison,	her	humour	was	dangerously	impregnated	with	the	consciousness

that	she	had	played	the	fool	to	such	an	extent	that	she	stood	in	a	fair	way	to	lose her	necklace.	Inasmuch	as	she	knew	this	to	be	altogether	her	fault,	whatever	the

outcome,	 she	 was	 in	 a	 mood	 to	 quarrel	 with	 the	 whole	 wide	 world;	 and	 she schooled	 herself	 to	 treat	 with	 Staff	 on	 terms	 of	 toleration	 only	 by	 exercise	 of considerable	self-command	and	because	she	was	exacting	a	service	of	him.

So	their	ride	uptown	was	marked	by	its	atmosphere	of	distant	and	dispassionate

civility.	They	spoke	infrequently,	and	then	on	indifferent	topics	soon	suffered	to languish.	 In	 due	 course,	 however,	 Staff	 mastered	 his	 resentment	 and—as

evidenced	 by	 his	 wry,	 secret	 smile—began	 to	 take	 a	 philosophic	 view	 of	 the

situation,	to	extract	some	slight	amusement	from	his	insight	into	Alison’s	mental processes.	Intuitively	sensing	this,	she	grew	even	more	exasperated	with	him—

as	well	as	with	everybody	aside	from	her	own	impeccable	self.

At	 the	 St.	 Simon,	 Staff	 soberly	 escorted	 the	 woman	 to	 the	 lounge,	 meaning	 to leave	her	there	while	he	enquired	for	Eleanor	at	the	office;	but	they	had	barely

set	foot	in	the	apartment	when	their	names	were	shrieked	at	them	in	an	excitable,

shrill,	feminine	voice,	and	Mrs.	Ilkington	bore	down	upon	them	in	full	regalia	of

sensation.

“My	dears!”	she	cried,	regarding	them	affectionately—“such	a	surprise!	Such	a

delightful	 surprise!	 And	 so	 good	 of	 you	 to	 come	 to	 see	 me	 so	 soon!	 And opportune—I’m	dying,	positively	expiring,	for	somebody	to	gossip	with.	Such	a

singular	thing	has	happened—”

Alison	 interrupted	 bluntly:	 “Where’s	 Miss	 Searle?	 Mr.	 Staff	 is	 anxious	 to	 see her.”

“That’s	just	it— just	what	I	want	to	talk	about.	You’d	never	guess	what	that	girl has	done—and	after	all	the	trouble	and	thought	I’ve	taken	in	her	behalf,	too!	I’m

disgusted,	positively	and	finally	disgusted;	never	again	will	I	interest	myself	in such	people.	I—”

“But	where	is	Miss	Searle?”	demanded	Alison,	with	a	significant	look	to	Staff.

“Gone!”	announced	Mrs.	Ilkington	impressively.

“Gone?”	echoed	Staff.

Mrs.	 Ilkington	 nodded	 vigorously,	 compressing	 her	 lips	 to	 a	 thin	 line	 of disapproval.	“I’m	positively	at	my	wits’	end	to	account	for	her.”

“I	fancy	there’s	an	explanation,	however,”	Alison	put	in.

“I	 wish	 you’d	 tell	 me,	 then....	 You	 see,	 we	 dined	 out,	 went	 to	 the	 theatre	 and supper	 together,	 last	 night.	 The	 Struyvers	 asked	 me,	 and	 I	 made	 them	 include her,	of	course.	We	got	back	about	one.	Of	course,	my	dears,	I	was	fearfully	tired

and	didn’t	get	up	till	half	an	hour	ago.	Imagine	my	sensation	when	I	enquired	for

Miss	Searle	and	was	informed	that	she	paid	her	bill	and	left	at	five	o’clock	this

morning,	and	with	 a	strange	man! ”

“She	left	you	a	note,	of	course?”	Staff	suggested.

“Not	a	line—nothing!	I	might	be	the	dirt	beneath	her	feet,	the	way	she’s	treated me.	I’m	thoroughly	disillusioned—disgusted!”

“Pardon	me,”	said	Staff;	“I’ll	have	a	word	with	the	office.”

He	 hurried	 away,	 leaving	 Mrs.	 Ilkington	 still	 volubly	 dilating	 on	 that	 indignity that	had	been	put	upon	her:	Alison	listening	with	an	air	of	infinite	detachment.

His	 enquiry	 was	 fruitless	 enough.	 The	 day-clerk,	 he	 was	 informed	 by	 that personage,	 had	 not	 come	 on	 duty	 until	 eight	 o’clock;	 he	 knew	 nothing	 of	 the affair	 beyond	 what	 he	 had	 been	 told	 by	 the	 night-clerk—that	 Miss	 Searle	 had called	for	her	bill	and	paid	it	at	five	o’clock;	had	given	instructions	to	have	her luggage	 removed	 from	 her	 room	 and	 delivered	 on	 presentation	 of	 her	 written order;	and	had	then	left	the	hotel	in	company	with	a	gentleman	who	registered	as

“I.	Arbuthnot”	at	one	o’clock	in	the	morning,	paying	for	his	room	in	advance.

Staff,	 consumed	 with	 curiosity	 about	 this	 gentleman,	 was	 so	 persistent	 in	 his enquiry	 that	 he	 finally	 unearthed	 the	 bellboy	 who	 had	 shown	 that	 guest	 to	 his room	and	who	furnished	what	seemed	to	be	a	tolerably	accurate	sketch	of	him.

The	man	described	was—Iff.

Discouraged	and	apprehensive,	Staff	returned	to	the	lounge	and	made	his	report

—one	received	by	Alison	with	frigid	disapproval,	by	Mrs.	Ilkington	with	every

symptom	of	cordial	animation;	from	which	it	became	immediately	apparent	that

Alison	had	told	the	elder	woman	everything	she	should	not	have	told	her.

“‘I.	Arbuthnot,’”	Alison	translated:	“Arbuthnot	Ismay.”

“Gracious!”	 Mrs.	 Ilkington	 squealed.	 “Isn’t	 that	 the	 real	 name	 of	 that	 odd creature	who	called	himself	Iff	and	pretended	to	be	a	Secret	Service	man?”

Staff	nodded	a	glum	assent.

“It’s	plain	enough,”	Alison	went	on;	“this	Searle	woman	was	in	league	with	him

—”

“I	disagree	with	you,”	said	Staff.

“On	what	grounds?”

“I	don’t	believe	that	Miss	Searle—”

“On	what	grounds?”

He	shrugged,	acknowledging	his	inability	to	explain.

“And	what	will	you	do?”	interrupted	Mrs.	Ilkington.

“I	shall	inform	the	police,	of	course,”	said	Alison;	“and	the	sooner	the	better.”

“If	 I	 may	 venture	 so	 far,”	 Staff	 said	 stiffly,	 “I	 advise	 you	 to	 do	 nothing	 of	 the sort.”

“And	why	not,	if	you	please?”

“It’s	 rather	 a	 delicate	 case,”	 he	 said—“if	 you’ll	 pause	 to	 consider	 it.	 You	 must not	 forget	 that	 you	 yourself	 broke	 the	 law	 when	 you	 contrived	 to	 smuggle	 the necklace	 into	 this	 country.	 The	 minute	 you	 make	 this	 matter	 public,	 you	 lay yourself	open	to	arrest	and	prosecution	for	swindling	the	Government.”

“Swindling!”	Alison	repeated	with	a	flaming	face.

Staff	 bowed,	 confirming	 the	 word.	 “It	 is	 a	 very	 serious	 charge	 these	 days,”	 he said	soberly.	“I’d	advise	you	to	think	twice	before	you	make	any	overt	move.”

“But	if	I	deny	attempting	to	smuggle	the	necklace?	If	I	insist	that	it	was	stolen

from	me	aboard	the	Autocratic—stolen	by	this	Mr.	Ismay	and	this	Searle	woman

—?”

“Miss	 Searle	 did	 not	 steal	 your	 necklace.	 If	 she	 had	 intended	 anything	 of	 the sort,	she	wouldn’t	have	telephoned	me	about	it	last	night.”

“Nevertheless,	 she	 has	 gone	 away	 with	 it,	 arm-in-arm	 with	 a	 notorious	 thief, hasn’t	she?”

“We’re	not	yet	positive	what	she	has	done.	For	my	part,	I	am	confident	she	will

communicate	with	us	and	return	the	necklace	with	the	least	possible	delay.”

“Nevertheless,	I	shall	set	the	police	after	her!”	Alison	insisted	obstinately.

“Again	I	advise	you—”

“But	I	shall	deny	the	smuggling,	base	my	charge	on—”

“One	moment,”	Staff	interposed	firmly.	“You	forget	me.	I’m	afraid	I	can	adduce

considerable	evidence	to	prove	that	you	not	only	attempted	to	smuggle,	but	as	a

matter	of	fact	did.”

“And	you	would	do	that—to	me?”	snapped	the	actress.

“I	 mean	 that	 Miss	 Searle	 shall	 have	 every	 chance	 to	 prove	 her	 innocence,”	 he returned	in	an	even	and	unyielding	voice.

“Why?	What’s	your	interest	in	her?”

“Simple	justice,”	he	said—and	knew	his	answer	to	be	evasive	and	unconvincing.

“As	a	matter	of	fact,”	said	Alison,	rising	in	her	anger,	“you’ve	fallen	in	love	with the	girl!”

Staff	held	her	gaze	in	silence.

“You’re	in	love	with	her,”	insisted	the	actress—“in	love	with	this	common	thief

and	confidence-woman!”

Staff	nodded	gently.	“Perhaps,”	said	he,	“you’re	right.	I	hadn’t	thought	of	it	that way	before....	But,	if	you	doubt	my	motive	in	advising	you	to	go	slow,	consult

somebody	 else—somebody	 you	 feel	 you	 can	 trust:	 Max,	 for	 instance,	 or	 your attorney.	Meanwhile,	I’d	ask	Mrs.	Ilkington	to	be	discreet,	if	I	were	you.”

Saluting	 them	 ceremoniously,	 he	 turned	 and	 left	 the	 hotel,	 deeply	 dejected, profoundly	bewildered	and	...	wondering	whether	or	not	Alison	in	her	rage	had

uncovered	 a	 secret	 unsuspected	 even	 by	 himself,	 to	 whom	 it	 should	 have	 been most	intimate.





XII

WON’T	YOU	WALK	INTO	MY	PARLOUR?

Slipping	quickly	into	the	room	through	an	opening	hardly	wide	enough	to	admit

his	spare,	small	body,	the	man	as	quickly	shut	and	locked	the	door	and	pocketed

the	 key.	 This	 much	 accomplished,	 he	 swung	 on	 his	 heel	 and,	 without	 further movement,	fastened	his	attention	anew	upon	the	girl.

Standing	so—hands	clasped	loosely	before	him,	his	head	thrust	forward	a	trifle

above	 his	 rounded	 shoulders,	 pale	 eyes	 peering	 from	 their	 network	 of	 wrinkles with	 a	 semi-humourous	 suggestion,	 thin	 lips	 curved	 in	 an	 apologetic	 grin:	 his likeness	 to	 the	 Mr.	 Iff	 known	 to	 Staff	 was	 something	 more	 than	 striking.	 One needed	to	be	intimately	and	recently	acquainted	with	Iff’s	appearance	to	be	able

to	 detect	 the	 almost	 imperceptible	 points	 of	 difference	 between	 the	 two.	 Had Staff	been	there	he	might	have	questioned	the	colour	of	this	man’s	eyes,	which

showed	a	lighter	tint	than	Iff’s,	and	their	expression—here	vigilant	and	predatory in	contrast	with	Iff’s	languid,	half-derisive	look.	The	line	of	the	cheek	from	nose to	mouth,	too,	was	deeper	and	more	hard	than	with	Iff;	and	there	was	a	hint	of

elevation	 in	 the	 nostrils	 that	 lent	 the	 face	 a	 guise	 of	 malice	 and	 evil—like	 the shadow	of	an	impersonal	sneer.

The	look	he	bent	upon	Eleanor	was	almost	a	sneer:	a	smile	in	part	contemptuous,

in	part	studious;	as	though	he	pondered	a	problem	in	human	chemistry	from	the

view-point	of	a	seasoned	and	experienced	scientist.	He	cocked	his	head	a	bit	to

one	side	and	stared	insolently	beneath	half-lowered	lids,	now	and	again	nodding

ever	so	slightly	as	if	in	confirmation	of	some	unspoken	conclusion.

Against	the	cold,	inflexible	purpose	in	his	manner,	the	pitiful	prayer	expressed	in the	girl’s	attitude	spent	itself	without	effect.	Her	hands	dropped	to	her	sides;	her head	 drooped	 wearily,	 hopelessly;	 her	 pose	 personified	 despondency	 profound and	irremediable.

When	he	had	timed	his	silence	cunningly,	to	ensure	the	most	impressive	effect,

the	man	moved,	shifting	from	one	foot	to	the	other,	and	spoke.

“Well,	Nelly	...?”

His	voice,	modulated	to	an	amused	drawl,	was	much	like	Iff’s.

The	girl’s	lips	moved	noiselessly	for	an	instant	before	she	managed	to	articulate.

“So,”	she	said	in	a	quiet	tone	of	horror—“So	it	was	you	all	the	time!”

“What	was	me?”	enquired	the	man	inelegantly	if	with	spirit.

“I	mean,”	she	said,	“you	 were	after	the	necklace,	after	all.”

“To	be	sure,”	he	said	pertly.	“What	did	you	think?”

“I	 hoped	 it	 wasn’t	 so,”	 she	 said	 brokenly.	 “When	 you	 escaped	 yesterday

morning,	and	when	tonight	I	found	the	necklace—I	was	so	glad!”

“Then	you	did	find	it?”	he	demanded	promptly.

She	gave	him	a	look	of	contempt.	“You	know	it!”

“My	dear	child,”	he	expostulated	insincerely,	“what	makes	you	say	that?”

“You	don’t	mean	to	pretend	you	didn’t	steal	the	bandbox	from	me,	just	now,	in

that	taxicab,	trying	to	get	the	necklace?”	she	demanded.

He	waited	an	instant,	then	shrugged.	“I	presume	denial	would	be	useless.”

“Quite.”

“All	right	then:	I	won’t	deny	anything.”

She	 moved	 away	 from	 the	 telephone	 to	 a	 chair	 wherein	 she	 dropped	 as	 if exhausted,	hands	knitted	together	in	her	lap,	her	chin	resting	on	her	chest.

“You	 see,”	 said	 the	 man,	 “I	 wanted	 to	 spare	 you	 the	 knowledge	 that	 you	 were being	held	up	by	your	fond	parent.”

“I	 should	 have	 known	 you,”	 she	 said,	 “but	 for	 that	 disguise—the	 beard	 and motor-coat.”

“That	just	goes	to	show	that	filial	affection	will	out,”	commented	the	man.	“You

haven’t	seen	me	for	seven	years—”

“Except	on	the	steamer,”	she	corrected.

“True,	but	there	I	kept	considerately	out	of	your	way.”

“Considerately!”	she	echoed	in	a	bitter	tone.

“Can	 you	 question	 it?”	 he	 asked,	 lightly	 ironic,	 moving	 noiselessly	 to	 and	 fro while	appraising	the	contents	of	the	room	with	swift,	searching	glances.

“As,	for	instance,	your	actions	tonight....”

“They	simply	prove	my	contention,	dear	child.”	He	paused,	gazing	down	at	her

with	a	quizzical	leer.	“My	very	presence	here	affirms	my	entire	devotion	to	your

welfare.”

She	 looked	 up,	 dumfounded	 by	 his	 effrontery.	 “Is	 it	 worth	 while	 to	 waste	 your time	so?”	she	enquired.	“You	failed	the	first	time	tonight,	but	you	can’t	fail	now; I’m	 alone,	 I	 can’t	 oppose	 you,	 and	 you	 know	 I	 won’t	 raise	 an	 alarm.	 Why	 not stop	 talking,	 take	 what	 you	 want	 and	 go?	 And	 leave	 me	 to	 be	 accused	 of	 theft unless	I	choose	to	tell	the	world—what	it	wouldn’t	believe—that	my	own	father

stole	the	necklace	from	me!”

“Ah,	 but	 how	 unjust	 you	 are!”	 exclaimed	 the	 man.	 “How	 little	 you	 know	 me, how	little	you	appreciate	a	father’s	affection!”

“And	you	tried	to	rob	me	not	two	hours	ago!”

“Yes,”	he	said	cheerfully:	“I	admit	it.	If	I	had	got	away	with	it	then—well	and

good.	 You	 need	 never	 have	 known	 who	 it	 was.	 Unhappily	 for	 both	 of	 us,	 you fooled	me.”

“For	both	of	us?”	she	repeated	blankly.

“Precisely.	It	puts	you	in	a	most	serious	position.	That’s	why	I’m	here—to	save

you.”

In	spite	of	her	fatigue,	the	girl	rose	to	face	him.	“What	do	you	mean?”

“Simply	that	between	us	we’ve	gummed	this	business	up	neatly—hard	and	fast.

You	 see—I	 hadn’t	 any	 use	 for	 that	 hat;	 I	 stopped	 in	 at	 an	 all-night	 telegraph station	 and	 left	 it	 to	 be	 delivered	 to	 Miss	 Landis,	 never	 dreaming	 what	 the consequences	 would	 be.	 Immediately	 thereafter,	 but	 too	 late,	 I	 learned—I’ve	 a way	 of	 finding	 out	 what’s	 going	 on,	 you	 know—that	 Miss	 Landis	 had	 already put	 the	 case	 in	 the	 hands	 of	 the	 police.	 It	 makes	 it	 very	 serious	 for	 you—the bandbox	 returned,	 the	 necklace	 still	 in	 your	 possession,	 your	 wild,	 incredible yarn	about	meaning	to	restore	it	...”

In	 her	 overwrought	 and	 harassed	 condition,	 the	 sophistry	 illuded	 her;	 she	 was

sensible	 only	 of	 the	 menace	 his	 words	 distilled.	 She	 saw	 herself	 tricked	 and trapped,	meshed	in	a	web	of	damning	circumstance;	everything	was	against	her

—appearances,	 the	 hands	 of	 all	 men,	 the	 cruel	 accident	 that	 had	 placed	 the necklace	 in	 her	 keeping,	 even	 her	 parentage.	 For	 she	 was	 the	 daughter	 of	 a notorious	 thief,	 a	 man	 whose	 name	 was	 an	 international	 byword.	 Who	 would believe	 her	 protestations	 of	 innocence—presuming	 that	 the	 police	 should	 find her	before	she	could	reach	either	Staff	or	Miss	Landis?

“But,”	she	faltered,	white	to	her	lips,	“I	can	take	it	to	her	now—instantly—”

Instinctively	 she	 clutched	 her	 handbag.	 The	 man’s	 eyes	 appreciated	 the

movement.	 His	 face	 was	 shadowed	 for	 a	 thought	 by	 the	 flying	 cloud	 of	 a sardonic	smile.	And	the	girl	saw	and	read	that	smile.

“Unless,”	she	stammered,	retreating	from	him	a	pace	or	two—“unless	you—”

He	silenced	her	with	a	reassuring	gesture.

“You	do	misjudge	me!”	he	said	in	a	voice	that	fairly	wept.

Hope	flamed	in	her	eyes.	“You	mean—you	can’t	mean—”

Again	he	lifted	his	hand.	“I	mean	that	you	misconstrue	my	motive.	Far	be	it	from

me	 to	 deny	 that	 I	 am—what	 I	 am.	 We	 have	 ever	 been	 plain-spoken	 with	 one another.	You	told	me	what	I	was	seven	years	ago,	when	you	left	me,	took	another

name,	 disowned	 me	 and	 ...”	 His	 voice	 broke	 affectingly	 for	 an	 instant.	 “No matter,”	he	resumed,	with	an	obvious	effort.	“The	past	is	past,	and	I	am	punished

for	 all	 that	 I	 have	 ever	 done	 or	 ever	 may	 do,	 by	 the	 loss	 of	 my	 daughter’s confidence	and	affection.	It	is	my	fault;	I	have	no	right	to	complain.	But	now	...

Yes,	 I	 admit	 I	 tried	 to	 steal	 the	 necklace	 in	 the	 Park	 tonight.	 But	 I	 failed,	 and failing	I	did	that	which	got	you	into	trouble.	Now	I’m	here	to	help	you	extricate

yourself.	 Don’t	 worry	 about	 the	 necklace—keep	 it,	 hide	 it	 where	 you	 will.	 I don’t	want	and	shan’t	touch,	it	on	any	conditions.”

“You	mean	I’m	free	to	return	it	to	Miss	Landis?”	she	gasped,	incredulous.

“Just	that.”

“Then—where	can	I	find	her?”

He	shrugged.	“There’s	the	rub.	She’s	left	town.”

She	steadied	herself	with	a	hand	on	the	table.	“Still	I	can	follow	her....”

“Yes—and	must.	That’s	what	I’ve	come	to	tell	you	and	to	help	you	do.”

“Where	has	she	gone?”

“To	her	country	place	in	Connecticut,	on	the	Sound	shore.”

“How	can	I	get	there?	By	railroad?”	Eleanor	started	toward	the	telephone.

“Hold	on!”	he	said	sharply.	“What	are	you	going	to	do?”

“Order	a	time-table—”

“Useless,”	he	commented	curtly.	“Every	terminal	in	the	city	is	already	watched

by	 detectives.	 They’d	 spot	 you	 in	 a	 twinkling.	 Your	 only	 salvation	 is	 to	 get	 to Miss	Landis	before	they	catch	you.”

In	 her	 excitement	 and	 confusion	 she	 could	 only	 stand	 and	 stare.	 A	 solitary thought	dominated	her	consciousness,	dwarfing	and	distorting	all	others:	she	was

in	 danger	 of	 arrest,	 imprisonment,	 the	 shame	 and	 ignominy	 of	 public

prosecution.	 Even	 though	 she	 were	 to	 be	 cleared	 of	 the	 charge,	 the	 stain	 of	 it would	cling	to	her,	an	ineradicable	blot.

And	every	avenue	of	escape	was	closed	to	her!	Her	lips	trembled	and	her	eyes

brimmed,	glistening.	Despair	lay	cold	in	her	heart.

She	was	so	weary	and	distraught	with	the	strain	of	nerves	taut	and	vibrant	with

emotion,	that	she	was	by	no	means	herself.	She	had	no	time	for	either	thought	or

calm	consideration;	and	even	with	plenty	of	time,	she	would	have	found	herself

unable	to	think	clearly	and	calmly.

“What	am	I	to	do,	then?”	she	whispered.

“Trust	me,”	the	man	replied	quietly.	“There’s	just	one	way	to	reach	this	woman

without	 risk	 of	 detection—and	 that’s	 good	 only	 if	 we	 act	 now.	Get	your	things together;	 pay	 your	 bill;	 leave	 word	 to	 deliver	 your	 trunks	 to	 your	 order;	 and come	with	me.	I	have	a	motor-car	waiting	round	the	corner.	In	an	hour	we	can	be

out	of	the	city.	By	noon	I	can	have	you	at	Miss	Landis’	home.”

“Yes,”	she	cried,	almost	hysterical—“yes,	that’s	the	way!”

“Then	do	what	packing	you	must.	Here,	I’ll	lend	a	hand.”

Fortunately,	 Eleanor	 had	 merely	 opened	 her	 trunks	 and	 bags,	 removing	 only such	 garments	 and	 toilet	 accessories	 as	 she	 had	 required	 for	 dinner	 and	 the

theatre.	These	lay	scattered	about	the	room,	easily	to	be	gathered	up	and	stuffed with	careless	haste	into	her	trunks.	In	ten	minutes	the	man	was	turning	the	keys

in	their	various	locks,	while	she	stood	waiting	with	a	small	handbag	containing	a

few	necessaries,	a	motor-coat	over	her	arm,	a	thick	veil	draped	from	her	hat.

“One	 minute,”	 the	 man	 said,	 straightening	 up	 from	 the	 last	 piece	 of	 luggage.

“You	were	telephoning	when	I	came	in?”

“Yes—to	Mr.	Staff,	to	explain	why	I	failed	to	bring	him	the	bandbox.”

“Hmmm. ”	 He	 pondered	 this,	 chin	 in	 hand.	 “He’ll	 be	 fretting.	 Does	 he	 know where	you	are?”

“No—I	forgot	to	tell	him.”

“That’s	 good.	 Still,	 you’d	 better	 call	 him	 up	 again	 and	 put	 his	 mind	 at	 rest.	 It may	gain	us	a	few	hours.”

“What	am	I	to	say?”

She	lifted	her	hand	to	the	receiver.

“Tell	him	you	were	cut	off	and	had	trouble	getting	his	number	again.	Say	your

motor	broke	down	in	Central	Park	and	you	lost	your	way	trying	to	walk	home.

Say	 you’re	 tired	 and	 don’t	 want	 to	 be	 disturbed	 till	 noon;	 that	 you	 have	 the necklace	safe	and	will	give	it	to	him	if	he	will	call	tomorrow.”

Eleanor	 took	 a	 deep	 breath,	 gave	 the	 number	 to	 the	 switchboard	 operator	 and before	 she	 had	 time	 to	 give	 another	 instant’s	 consideration	 to	 what	 she	 was doing,	 found	 herself	 in	 conversation	 with	 Staff,	 reciting	 the	 communication outlined	by	her	evil	genius	in	response	to	his	eager	questioning.

The	man	was	at	her	elbow	all	the	while	she	talked—so	close	that	he	could	easily

overhear	the	other	end	of	the	dialogue.	This	was	with	a	purpose	made	manifest

when	Staff	asked	Eleanor	where	she	was	stopping,	when	instantly	the	little	man

clapped	his	palm	over	the	transmitter.

“Tell	him	the	St.	Regis,”	he	said	in	a	sharp	whisper.

Her	eyes	demanded	the	reason	why.

“Don’t	stop	to	argue—do	as	I	say:	it’ll	give	us	more	time.	The	St.	Regis!”

He	 removed	 his	 hand.	 Blindly	 she	 obeyed,	 reiterating	 the	 name	 to	 Staff	 and

presently	saying	good-bye.

“And	now—not	a	second	to	spare—hurry!”

In	the	hallway,	while	they	waited	for	the	elevator,	he	had	further	instructions	for her.

“Go	to	the	desk	and	ask	for	your	bill,”	he	said,	handing	her	the	key	to	her	room.

“You’ve	money,	of	course?...	Say	that	you’re	called	unexpectedly	away	and	will

send	a	written	order	for	your	trunks	early	in	the	morning.	If	the	clerk	wants	an

address,	tell	him	the	Auditorium,	Chicago.	Now	...”

They	stepped	from	the	dimly	lighted	hall	into	the	brilliant	cage	of	the	elevator.	It dropped,	silently,	swiftly,	to	the	ground	floor,	somehow	suggesting	to	the	girl	the workings	 of	 her	 implacable,	 irresistible	 destiny.	 So	 precisely,	 she	 felt,	 she	 was being	whirled	on	to	her	fate,	like	a	dry	leaf	in	a	gale,	with	no	more	volition,	as impotent	to	direct	her	course....

Still	under	the	obsession	of	this	idea,	she	went	to	the	desk,	paid	her	bill	and	said what	she	had	been	told	to	say	about	her	trunks.	Beyond	that	point	she	did	not	go,

chiefly	 because	 she	 had	 forgotten	 and	 was	 too	 numb	 with	 fatigue	 to	 care.	 The clerk’s	 question	 as	 to	 her	 address	 failed	 to	 reach	 her	 understanding;	 she	 turned away	without	responding	and	went	to	join	at	the	door	the	man	who	seemed	able

to	sway	her	to	his	whim.

She	 found	 herself	 walking	 in	 the	 dusky	 streets,	 struggling	 to	 keep	 up	 with	 the rapid	pace	set	by	the	man	at	her	side.

After	some	time	they	paused	before	a	building	in	a	side	street.	By	its	low	façade

and	huge	sliding	doors	she	dimly	perceived	it	to	be	a	private	garage.	In	response

to	 a	 signal	 of	 peculiar	 rhythm	 knuckled	 upon	 the	 wood	 by	 her	 companion,	 the doors	rolled	back.	A	heavy-eyed	mechanic	saluted	them	drowsily.	On	the	edge	of

the	threshold	a	high-powered	car	with	a	close-coupled	body	stood	ready.

With	 the	 docility	 of	 that	 complete	 indifference	 which	 is	 bred	 of	 deadening weariness,	she	submitted	to	being	helped	to	her	seat,	arranged	her	veil	to	protect her	 face	 and	 sat	 back	 with	 folded	 hands,	 submissive	 to	 endure	 whatsoever chance	or	mischance	there	might	be	in	store	for	her.

The	 small	 man	 took	 the	 seat	 by	 her	 side;	 the	 mechanic	 cranked	 and	 jumped	 to his	place.	The	motor	snorted,	trembling	like	a	thoroughbred	about	to	run	a	race,

then	subsiding	with	a	sonorous	purr	swept	sedately	out	into	the	deserted	street,

swung	round	a	corner	into	Broadway,	settled	its	tires	into	the	grooves	of	the	car-tracks	and	leaped	northwards	like	an	arrow.

The	 thoroughfare	 was	 all	 but	 bare	 of	 traffic.	 Now	 and	 again	 they	 had	 to	 swing away	 from	 the	 car-tracks	 to	 pass	 a	 surface-car;	 infrequently	 they	 passed	 early milk	 wagons,	 crawling	 reluctantly	 over	 their	 routes.	 Pedestrians	 were	 few	 and far	 between,	 and	 only	 once,	 when	 they	 dipped	 into	 the	 hollow	 at	 Manhattan Street,	was	it	necessary	to	reduce	speed	in	deference	to	the	law	as	bodied	forth	in a	balefully	glaring,	solitary	policeman.

The	silken	song	of	six	cylinders	working	in	absolute	harmony	was	as	soothing	as

a	lullaby,	the	sweep	of	the	soft,	fresh	morning	air	past	one’s	cheeks	as	soft	and

quieting	as	a	mother’s	caress.	Eleanor	yielded	to	their	influence	as	naturally	as	a tired	 child.	 Her	 eyes	 closed;	 she	 breathed	 regularly,	 barely	 conscious	 of	 the sensation	of	resistless	flight.

Hot	and	level,	the	rays	of	the	rising	sun	smote	her	face	and	roused	her	as	the	car crossed	McComb’s	Dam	Bridge;	and	for	a	little	time	thereafter	she	was	drowsily

sentient—aware	of	wheeling	streets	and	endless,	marching	ranks	of	houses.	Then

again	she	dozed,	recovering	her	senses	only	when,	after	a	lapse	of	perhaps	half

an	 hour,	 the	 noise	 of	 the	 motor	 ceased	 and	 the	 big	 machine	 slowed	 down smoothly	to	a	dead	halt.

She	 opened	 her	 eyes,	 comprehending	 dully	 a	 complete	 change	 in	 the	 aspect	 of the	 land.	 They	 had	 stopped	 on	 the	 right	 of	 the	 road,	 in	 front	 of	 a	 low-roofed wooden	 building	 whose	 signboard	 creaking	 overhead	 in	 the	 breeze	 named	 the place	 an	 inn.	 To	 the	 left	 lay	 a	 stretch	 of	 woodland;	 and	 there	 were	 trees,	 too, behind	 the	 inn,	 but	 in	 less	 thick	 array,	 so	 that	 it	 was	 possible	 to	 catch	 through their	trunks	and	foliage	glimpses	of	blue	water	splashed	with	golden	sunlight.	A

soft	 air	 fanned	 in	 off	 the	 water,	 sweet	 and	 clean.	 The	 sky	 was	 high	 and profoundly	blue,	unflecked	by	cloud.

With	 a	 feeling	 of	 gratitude,	 she	 struggled	 to	 recollect	 her	 wits	 and	 realise	 her position;	 but	 still	 her	 weariness	 was	 heavy	 upon	 her.	 The	 man	 she	 called	 her father	 was	 coming	 down	 the	 path	 from	 the	 inn	 doorway.	 He	 carried	 a	 tumbler brimming	 with	 a	 pale	 amber	 liquid.	 Walking	 round	 to	 her	 side	 of	 the	 car	 he offered	it.

“Drink	this,”	she	heard	him	say	in	a	pleasant	voice;	“it’ll	help	you	brace	up.”

Obediently	she	accepted	the	glass	and	drank.	The	soul	of	the	stuff	broke	out	in

delicate,	 aromatic	 bubbles	 beneath	 her	 nostrils.	 There	 was	 a	 stinging	 but refreshing	 feeling	 in	 her	 mouth	 and	 throat.	 She	 said	 “champagne”	 sleepily	 to herself,	and	with	a	word	of	thanks	returned	an	empty	glass.

She	heard	the	man	laugh,	and	in	confusion	wondered	why.	If	anything,	she	felt

more	sleepy	than	before.

He	 climbed	 back	 into	 his	 seat.	 A	 question	 crawled	 in	 her	 brain,	 tormenting.

Finally	she	managed	to	enunciate	a	part	of	it:

“How	much	longer	...?”

“Oh,	not	a	great	ways	now.”

The	 response	 seemed	 to	 come	 from	 a	 far	 distance.	 She	 felt	 the	 car	 moving beneath	her	and	...	no	more.	Sleep	possessed	her	utterly,	heavy	and	dreamless....

There	 followed	 several	 phases	 of	 semi-consciousness	 wherein	 she	 moved	 by

instinct	alone,	seeing	men	as	trees	walking,	the	world	as	through	a	mist.

In	one,	she	was	being	helped	out	of	the	motor-car.	Then	somebody	was	holding

her	arm	and	guiding	her	along	a	path	of	some	sort.	Planks	rang	hollowly	beneath

her	 feet,	 and	 the	 hand	 on	 her	 arm	 detained	 her.	 A	 voice	 said:	 “This	 way—just step	right	out;	you’re	perfectly	safe.”	Mechanically	she	obeyed.	She	felt	herself

lurch	 as	 if	 to	 fall,	 and	 then	 hands	 caught	 and	 supported	 her	 as	 she	 stood	 on something	that	swayed.	The	voice	that	had	before	spoken	was	advising	her	to	sit

down	 and	 take	 it	 easy.	 Accordingly,	 she	 sat	 down.	 Her	 seat	 was	 rocking	 like	 a swing,	 and	 she	 heard	 dimly	 the	 splash	 of	 waters;	 these	 merged	 unaccountably again	into	the	purring	of	a	motor....

And	 then	 somebody	 had	 an	 arm	 round	 her	 waist	 and	 she	 was	 walking,	 bearing heavily	 upon	 that	 support,	 partly	 because	 she	 sorely	 needed	 it	 but	 the	 more readily	because	she	knew	somehow—intuitively—that	the	arm	was	a	woman’s.

A	voice	assured	her	from	time	to	time:	“Not	much	farther	...”	And	she	was	sure

it	 was	 a	 woman’s	 voice....	 Then	 she	 was	 being	 helped	 to	 ascend	 a	 steep,	 long staircase....

She	 came	 to	 herself	 for	 a	 moment,	 probably	 not	 long	 after	 climbing	 the	 stairs.

She	 was	 sitting	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 a	 bed	 in	 a	 small,	 low-ceiled	 room,	 cheaply	 and meagrely	 furnished.	 Staring	 wildly	 about	 her,	 she	 tried	 to	 realise	 these surroundings.	 There	 were	 two	 windows,	 both	 open,	 admitting	 floods	 of	 sea	 air and	 sunlight;	 beyond	 them	 she	 saw	 green	 boughs	 swaying	 slowly,	 and	 through

the	boughs	patches	of	water,	blue	and	gold.	There	was	a	door	opposite	the	bed;	it stood	 open,	 revealing	 a	 vista	 of	 long,	 bare	 hallway,	 regularly	 punctuated	 by doors.

The	 drumming	 in	 her	 temples	 pained	 and	 bewildered	 her.	 Her	 head	 felt	 dense and	 heavy.	 She	 tried	 to	 think	 and	 failed.	 But	 the	 knowledge	 persisted	 that something	was	very	wrong	with	her	world—something	that	might	be	remedied,

set	right,	if	only	she	could	muster	up	strength	to	move	and	...	think.

Abruptly	the	doorway	was	filled	by	the	figure	of	a	woman,	a	strapping,	brawny

creature	with	the	arms	and	shoulders	of	a	man	and	a	great,	coarse,	good-natured

face.	 She	 came	 directly	 to	 the	 bed,	 sat	 down	 beside	 the	 girl,	 passed	 an	 arm behind	her	shoulders	and	offered	her	a	glass.

“You’ve	just	woke	up,	ain’t	you?”	she	said	soothingly.	“Drink	this	and	lay	down

and	 you’ll	 feel	 better	 before	 long.	 You	 have	 had	 a	 turn,	 and	 no	 mistake;	 but you’ll	 be	 all	 right	 now,	 never	 fear.	 Come	 now,	 drink	 it,	 and	 I’ll	 help	 you	 loose your	clothes	a	bit,	so	’s	you	can	be	comfortable....”

Somehow	 her	 tone	 inspired	 Eleanor	 with	 confidence.	 She	 drank,	 submitted	 to being	 partially	 undressed,	 and	 lay	 down.	 Sleep	 overcame	 her	 immediately:	 she suffered	a	sensation	of	dropping	plummet-wise	into	a	great	pit	of	oblivion....





XIII

WRECK	ISLAND

Suddenly,	with	a	smothered	cry	of	surprise,	Eleanor	sat	up.	She	seemed	to	have

recovered	 full	 consciousness	 and	 sensibility	 with	 an	 instantaneous	 effect

comparable	 only	 to	 that	 of	 electric	 light	 abruptly	 flooding	 a	 room	 at	 night.	 A moment	 ago	 she	 had	 been	 an	 insentient	 atom	 sunk	 deep	 in	 impenetrable	 night; now	she	was	herself—and	it	was	broad	daylight.

With	 an	 abrupt,	 automatic	 movement,	 she	 left	 the	 bed	 and	 stood	 up,	 staring incredulously	 at	 the	 substance	 of	 what	 still	 wore	 in	 her	 memory	 the	 guise	 of	 a dream.

But	it	had	been	no	dream,	after	all.	She	was	actually	in	the	small	room	with	the

low	ceiling	and	the	door	(now	shut)	and	the	windows	that	revealed	the	green	of

leaves	and	the	blue	and	gold	of	a	sun-spangled	sea.	And	her	coat	and	hat	and	veil

had	been	removed	and	were	hanging	from	nails	in	the	wall	behind	the	door,	and

her	 clothing	 had	 been	 unfastened—precisely	 as	 she	 dimly	 remembered

everything	that	had	happened	with	relation	to	the	strange	woman.

She	 wore	 a	 little	 wrist-watch.	 It	 told	 her	 that	 the	 hour	 was	 after	 four	 in	 the afternoon.

She	began	hurriedly	to	dress,	or	rather	to	repair	the	disorder	of	her	garments,	all the	 while	 struggling	 between	 surprise	 that	 she	 felt	 rested	 and	 well	 and	 strong, and	a	haunting	suspicion	that	she	had	been	tricked.

Of	the	truth	of	this	suspicion,	confirmatory	evidence	presently	overwhelmed	her.

Since	 that	 draught	 of	 champagne	 before	 the	 roadside	 inn	 shortly	 after	 sunrise, she	 had	 known	 nothing	 clearly.	 It	 was	 impossible	 that	 she	 could	 without knowing	 it	 have	 accomplished	 her	 purpose	 with	 relation	 to	 Alison	 Landis	 and the	 Cadogan	 collar.	 She	 saw	 now,	 she	 knew	 now	 beyond	 dispute,	 that	 she	 had been	 drugged—not	 necessarily	 heavily;	 a	 simple	 dose	 of	 harmless	 bromides

would	have	served	the	purpose	in	her	overtaxed	condition—and	brought	to	this

place	in	a	semi-stupor,	neither	knowing	whither	she	went	nor	able	to	object	had

she	known.

The	 discovery	 of	 her	 handbag	 was	 all	 that	 was	 required	 to	 transmute	 fears	 and doubts	into	irrefragable	knowledge.

No	longer	fastened	to	her	wrist	by	the	loop	of	its	silken	thong,	she	found	the	bag in	 plain	 sight	 on	 the	 top	 of	 a	 cheap	 pine	 bureau.	 With	 feverish	 haste	 she examined	it.	The	necklace	was	gone.

Dropping	the	bag,	she	stared	bitterly	at	her	distorted	reflection	in	a	cracked	and discoloured	mirror.

What	 a	 fool,	 to	 trust	 the	 man!	 In	 the	 clear	 illumination	 of	 unclouded	 reason which	she	was	now	able	to	bring	to	bear	upon	the	episode,	she	saw	with	painful

distinctness	how	readily	she	had	lent	herself	to	be	the	dupe	and	tool	of	the	man

she	 called	 her	 father.	 Nothing	 that	 he	 had	 urged	 upon	 her	 at	 the	 St.	 Simon	 had now	the	least	weight	in	her	understanding;	all	his	argument	was	now	seen	to	be

but	the	sheerest	sophistry,	every	statement	he	had	made	and	every	promise	fairly

riddled	 with	 treachery;	 hardly	 a	 phrase	 he	 had	 uttered	 would	 have	 gained	 an instant’s	 credence	 under	 the	 analysis	 of	 a	 normal	 intelligence.	 He	 could	 have accomplished	 nothing	 had	 she	 not	 been	 without	 sleep	 for	 nearly	 twenty-four hours,	 with	 every	 nerve	 and	 fibre	 and	 faculty	 aching	 for	 rest.	 But,	 so	 aided—

with	what	heartless	ease	had	he	beguiled	and	overreached	her!

Tears,	 hot	 and	 stinging,	 smarted	 in	 her	 eyes	 while	 she	 fumbled	 with	 the fastenings	of	her	attire—tears	of	chagrin	and	bitter	resentment.

As	 soon	 as	 she	 was	 ready	 and	 composed,	 she	 opened	 the	 door	 very	 gently	 and stepped	out	into	the	hall.

It	was	a	short	hall,	set	like	the	top	bar	of	a	T-square	at	the	end	of	a	long,	doorlined	 corridor.	 The	 walls	 were	 of	 white,	 plain	 plaster,	 innocent	 of	 paper	 and	 in some	places	darkly	blotched	with	damp	and	mildew.	The	floor,	though	solid,	was

uncarpeted.	Near	at	hand	a	flight	of	steps	ran	down	to	the	lower	floor.

After	a	moment	of	hesitation	she	chose	to	explore	the	long	corridor	rather	than	to descend	at	once	by	the	nearer	stairway;	and	gathering	her	skirts	about	her	ankles

(an	instinctive	precaution	against	making	a	noise	engendered	by	the	atmosphere

of	 the	 place	 rather	 than	 the	 result	 of	 coherent	 thought)	 she	 stole	 quietly	 along between	its	narrow	walls.

Although	 some	 few	 were	 closed,	 the	 majority	 of	 the	 doors	 she	 passed	 stood open;	and	these	all	revealed	small,	stuffy	cubicles	with	grimy,	unpainted	floors,

grimy	plaster	walls	and	ceilings	and	grimy	windows	whose	panes	were	framed in	 cobwebs	 and	 crusted	 so	 thick	 with	 the	 accumulated	 dust	 and	 damp	 of	 years that	they	lacked	little	of	complete	opacity.	No	room	contained	any	furnishing	of

any	sort.

The	farther	she	moved	from	her	bedroom,	the	more	close	and	stale	and	sluggish

seemed	 the	 air,	 the	 more	 oppressive	 the	 quiet	 of	 this	 strange	 tenement.	 The sound	of	her	footfalls,	light	and	stealthy	though	they	were,	sounded	to	her	ears

weirdly	 magnified	 in	 volume;	 and	 the	 thought	 came	 to	 her	 that	 if	 she	 were indeed	trespassing	upon	forbidden	quarters	of	the	mean	and	dismal	stronghold	of

some	modern	Bluebeard,	the	noise	she	was	making	would	quickly	enough	bring

the	 warders	 down	 upon	 her.	 And	 yet	 it	 must	 have	 been	 that	 her	 imagination exaggerated	 the	 slight	 sounds	 that	 attended	 her	 cautious	 advance;	 for	 presently she	had	proof	enough	that	they	could	have	been	audible	to	none	but	herself.

Half-way	down	the	corridor	she	came	unexpectedly	to	a	second	staircase;	double

the	 width	 of	 the	 other,	 it	 ran	 down	 to	 a	 broad	 landing	 and	 then	 in	 two	 short flights	to	the	ground	floor	of	the	building.	The	well	of	this	stairway	disclosed	a hall	rather	large	and	well-finished,	if	bare.	Directly	in	front	of	the	landing,	where the	 short	 flights	 branched	 at	 right	 angles	 to	 the	 main,	 was	 a	 large	 double	 door, one	 side	 of	 which	 stood	 slightly	 ajar.	 Putting	 this	 and	 that	 together,	 Eleanor satisfied	herself	that	she	overlooked	the	entrance-hall	and	office	of	an	out-of-the-way	summer	hotel,	neither	large	nor	in	any	way	pretentious	even	in	its	palmiest

days,	and	now	abandoned—or,	at	best,	consecrated	to	the	uses	of	caretakers	and

whoever	else	might	happen	to	inhabit	the	wing	whence	she	had	wandered.

Now	as	she	paused	for	an	instant,	looking	down	while	turning	this	thought	over

in	 her	 mind	 and	 considering	 the	 effect	 upon	 herself	 and	 fortunes	 of	 indefinite sequestration	 in	 such	 a	 spot,	 she	 was	 startled	 by	 a	 cough	 from	 some	 point invisible	to	her	in	the	hall	below.	On	the	heels	of	this,	she	heard	something	even more	 inexplicable:	 the	 dull	 and	 hollow	 clang	 of	 a	 heavy	 metal	 door.	 Footsteps were	audible	immediately:	the	quick,	nervous	footfalls	of	somebody	coming	to

the	front	of	the	house	from	a	point	behind	the	staircase.

Startled	and	curious,	the	girl	drew	back	a	careful	step	or	two	until	sheltered	by

the	 corridor	 wall	 at	 its	 junction	 with	 the	 balustrade.	 Here	 she	 might	 lurk	 and peer,	see	but	not	be	seen,	save	through	unhappy	mischance.

The	 man	 came	 promptly	 into	 view.	 She	 had	 foretold	 his	 identity,	 had	 known	 it would	be	...	he	whom	she	must	call	father.

He	moved	briskly	to	the	open	door,	paused	and	stood	looking	out	for	an	instant, then	with	his	air	of	furtive	alertness,	yet	apparently	sure	that	he	was	unobserved and	 wholly	 unsuspicious	 of	 the	 presence	 of	 the	 girl	 above	 him,	 swung	 back toward	the	staircase.	For	an	instant,	terrified	by	the	fear	that	he	meant	to	ascend, she	stood	poised	on	the	verge	of	flight;	but	that	he	had	another	intention	at	once became	 apparent.	 Stopping	 at	 the	 foot	 of	 the	 left-hand	 flight	 of	 steps,	 he	 laid hold	 of	 the	 turned	 knob	 on	 top	 of	 the	 outer	 newel-post	 and	 lifted	 it	 from	 its socket.	Then	he	took	something	from	his	coat	pocket,	dropped	it	into	the	hollow

of	 the	 newel,	 replaced	 the	 knob	 and	 turned	 and	 marched	 smartly	 out	 of	 the house,	shutting	the	door	behind	him.

Eleanor	noticed	that	he	didn’t	lock	it.

At	 the	 same	 time	 three	 separate	 considerations	 moved	 her	 to	 fly	 back	 to	 her room.	She	had	seen	something	not	intended	for	her	sight;	the	knowledge	might

somehow	prove	valuable	to	her;	and	if	she	were	discovered	in	the	corridor,	the

man	 might	 reasonably	 accuse	 her	 of	 spying.	 Incontinently	 she	 picked	 up	 her skirts	and	ran.

The	 distance	 wasn’t	 as	 great	 as	 she	 had	 thought;	 in	 a	 brief	 moment	 she	 was standing	before	the	door	of	the	bedroom	as	though	she	had	just	come	out—her

gaze	directed	expectantly	toward	the	small	staircase.

If	 she	 had	 anticipated	 a	 visit	 from	 her	 kidnapper,	 however,	 she	 was	 pleasantly disappointed.	Not	a	sound	came	from	below,	aside	from	a	dull	and	distant	thump

and	 thud	 which	 went	 on	 steadily,	 if	 in	 syncopated	 measure,	 and	 the	 source	 of which	perplexed	her.

At	length	she	pulled	herself	together	and	warily	descended	the	staircase.	It	ended in	what	was	largely	a	counterpart	of	the	hall	above:	as	on	the	upper	floor	broken

by	the	mouth	of	a	long	corridor,	but	with	a	door	at	its	rear	in	place	of	the	window upstairs.	 From	 beyond	 the	 door	 came	 the	 thumping,	 thudding	 sound	 that	 had puzzled	 Eleanor;	 but	 now	 she	 could	 distinguish	 something	 more:	 a	 woman’s voice	 crooning	 an	 age-old	 melody.	 Then	 the	 pounding	 ceased,	 shuffling

footsteps	were	audible,	and	a	soft	clash	of	metal	upon	metal:	shuffle	again,	and

again	the	intermittent,	deadened	pounding.

Suddenly	 she	 understood,	 and	 understanding	 almost	 smiled,	 in	 spite	 of	 her gnawing	anxiety,	to	think	that	she	had	been	mystified	so	long	by	a	noise	of	such

humble	 origin:	 merely	 that	 of	 a	 woman	 comfortably	 engaged	 in	 the	 household task	 of	 ironing.	 It	 was	 simple	 enough,	 once	 one	 thought	 of	 it;	 yet	 ridiculously

incongruous	when	injected	into	the	cognisance	of	a	girl	whose	brain	was	buzzing with	the	incredible	romance	of	her	position....

Without	further	ceremony	she	thrust	open	the	door	at	the	end	of	the	hallway.

There	 was	 disclosed	 a	 room	 of	 good	 size,	 evidently	 at	 one	 time	 a	 living-room, now	converted	to	the	combined	offices	of	kitchen	and	dining-room.	A	large	deal

table	in	the	middle	of	the	floor	was	covered	with	a	turkey-red	cloth,	with	places

set	 for	 four.	 On	 a	 small	 range	 in	 the	 recess	 of	 what	 had	 once	 been	 an	 open fireplace,	 sad-irons	 were	 heating	 side	 by	 side	 with	 simmering	 pots	 and	 a steaming	 tea-kettle.	 There	 was	 a	 rich	 aroma	 of	 cooking	 in	 the	 air,	 somewhat tinctured	by	the	smell	of	melting	wax,	but	in	spite	of	that	madly	appetising	to	the nostrils	of	a	young	woman	made	suddenly	aware	that	she	had	not	eaten	for	some

sixteen	 hours.	 The	 furnishings	 of	 the	 room	 were	 simple	 and	 characteristic	 of country	 kitchens—including	 even	 the	 figure	 of	 the	 sturdy	 woman	 placidly

ironing	white	things	on	a	board	near	the	open	door.

She	 looked	 up	 quickly	 as	 Eleanor	 entered,	 stopped	 her	 humming,	 smote	 the board	vigorously	with	the	iron	and	set	the	latter	on	a	metal	rest.

“Evening,”	she	said	pleasantly,	resting	her	hands	on	her	hips.

Eleanor	 stared	 dumbly,	 remembering	 that	 this	 was	 the	 woman	 who	 had	 helped her	 to	 bed	 and	 had	 administered	 what	 had	 presumably	 been	 a	 second	 sleeping draught.

“Thought	I	heard	you	moving	around	upstairs.	How	be	you?	Hungry?	I’ve	got	a

bite	ready.”

“I’d	like	a	drink	of	water,	please,”	said	Eleanor—“plain	water,”	she	added	with	a

significance	that	could	not	have	been	overlooked	by	a	guilty	conscience.

But	the	woman	seemed	to	sense	no	ulterior	meaning.	“I’ll	fetch	it,”	she	said	in	a

good-humoured	voice,	going	to	the	sink.

While	 she	 was	 manipulating	 the	 pump,	 the	 girl	 moved	 nearer,	 frankly	 taking stock	 of	 her.	 The	 dim	 impression	 retained	 from	 their	 meeting	 in	 the	 early morning	was	merely	emphasised	by	this	second	inspection;	the	woman	was	built

on	 generous	 lines—big-boned,	 heavy	 and	 apparently	 immensely	 strong.	 A

contented	 and	 easy-going	 humour	 shone	 from	 her	 broad,	 coarsely	 featured

countenance,	 oddly	 contending	 with	 a	 suggestion	 of	 implacable	 obstinacy	 and tenacious	purpose.

“Here	 you	 are,”	 she	 said	 presently,	 extending	 a	 glass	 filmed	 with	 the	 breath	 of the	ice-cold	liquid	it	contained.

“Thank	 you,”	 said	 Eleanor;	 and	 drank	 thirstily.	 “Who	 are	 you?”	 she	 demanded point	blank,	returning	the	glass.

“Mrs.	Clover,”	said	the	woman	as	bluntly,	if	with	a	smiling	mouth.

“Where	am	I?”

“Well”—the	 woman	 turned	 to	 the	 stove	 and	 busied	 herself	 with	 coffee-pot	 and frying-pan	 while	 she	 talked—“this	 was	 the	 Wreck	 Island	 House	 oncet	 upon	 a time.	 I	 calculate	 it’s	 that	 now,	 only	 it	 ain’t	 run	 as	 a	 hotel	 any	 more.	 It’s	 been years	since	there	was	any	summer	folks	come	here—place	didn’t	pay,	they	said;

guess	that’s	why	they	shet	it	up	and	how	your	pa	come	to	buy	it	for	a	song.”

“Where	is	the	Wreck	Island	House,	then?”	Eleanor	put	in.

“On	Wreck	Island,	of	course.”

“And	where	is	that?”

“In	 Long	 Island	 Sound,	 about	 a	 mile	 off	 ’n	 the	 Connecticut	 shore.	 Pennymint Centre’s	the	nearest	village.”

“That	means	nothing	to	me,”	said	the	girl.	“How	far	are	we	from	New	York?”

“I	 couldn’t	 rightly	 say—ain’t	 never	 been	 there.	 But	 your	 pa	 says—I	 heard	 him tell	 Eph	 once—he	 can	 make	 the	 run	 in	 his	 autymobile	 in	 an	 hour	 and	 a	 half.

That’s	from	Pennymint	Centre,	of	course.”

Eleanor	pressed	her	hands	to	her	temples,	temporarily	dazed	by	the	information.

“Island,”	she	repeated—“a	mile	from	shore—New	York	an	hour	and	a	half	away

...!”

“Good,	comfortable,	tight	little	island,”	resumed	Mrs.	Clover,	pleased,	it	seemed, with	 the	 sound	 of	 her	 own	 voice;	 “you’ll	 like	 it	 when	 you	 come	 to	 get acquainted.	Just	the	very	place	for	a	girl	with	your	trouble.”

“My	trouble?	What	do	you	know	about	that?”

“Your	 pa	 told	 me,	 of	 course.	 Nervous	 prostration’s	 what	 he	 called	 it—says	 as you	need	a	rest	with	quiet	and	nothing	to	disturb	you—plenty	of	good	food	and

sea	air—”

“Oh	stop!”	Eleanor	begged	frantically.

“Land!”	said	the	woman	in	a	kindly	tone—“I	might	’ve	known	I’d	get	on	your

poor	nerves,	talking	all	the	time.	But	I	can’t	seem	to	help	it,	living	here	all	alone like	 I	 do	 with	 nobody	 but	 Eph	 most	 of	 the	 time....	 There!”	 she	 added	 with satisfaction,	spearing	the	last	rasher	of	bacon	from	the	frying-pan	and	dropping	it on	a	plate—“now	your	breakfast’s	ready.	Draw	up	a	chair	and	eat	hearty.”

She	 put	 the	 plate	 on	 the	 red	 table-cloth,	 flanked	 it	 with	 dishes	 containing	 soft-boiled	eggs,	bread	and	butter	and	a	pot	of	coffee	of	delicious	savour,	and	waved

one	muscular	arm	over	it	all	with	the	gesture	of	a	benevolent	sorceress.	“Set	to

while	it’s	hot,	my	dear,	and	don’t	you	be	afraid;	good	food	never	hurt	nobody.”

Momentarily,	Eleanor	entertained	the	thought	of	mutinous	refusal	to	eat,	by	way

of	 lending	 emphasis	 to	 her	 indignation;	 but	 hunger	 overcame	 the	 attractions	 of this	dubious	expedient;	and	besides,	if	she	were	to	accomplish	anything	toward

regaining	her	freedom,	if	it	were	no	more	than	to	register	a	violent	protest,	she

would	need	strength;	and	already	she	was	weak	for	want	of	food.

So	she	took	her	place	and	ate—ate	ravenously,	enjoying	every	mouthful—even

though	her	mind	was	obsessed	with	doubts	and	fears	and	burning	anger.

“You	 are	 the	 caretaker	 here?”	 she	 asked	 as	 soon	 as	 her	 hunger	 was	 a	 little satisfied.

“Reckon	 you	 might	 call	 us	 that,	 me	 and	 Eph;	 we’ve	 lived	 here	 for	 five	 years now,	taking	care	of	the	island—ever	since	your	pa	bought	it.”

“Eph	is	your	husband?”

“That’s	him—Ephraim	Clover.”

“And—doesn’t	he	do	anything	else	but—caretake?”

“Lord	 bless	 you,	 he	 don’t	 even	 do	 that;	 I’m	 the	 caretaker ess.	 Eph	 don’t	 do nothing	 but	 potter	 round	 with	 the	 motor-boat	 and	 go	 to	 town	 for	 supplies	 and fish	a	little	and	’tend	to	the	garden	and	do	the	chores	and—”

“I	should	think	he	must	keep	pretty	busy.”

“Busy?	 Him?	 Eph?	 Lord!	 he’s	 the	 busiest	 thing	 you	 ever	 laid	 your	 eyes	 on—

poking	round	doing	nothing	at	all.”

“And	does	nobody	ever	come	here	...?”

“Nobody	but	the	boss.”

“Does	he	often—?”

“That’s	as	may	be	and	the	fit’s	on	him.	He	comes	and	goes,	just	as	he	feels	like.

Sometimes	he’s	on	and	off	the	island	half	a	dozen	times	a	week,	and	again	we

don’t	hear	nothing	of	him	for	months;	sometimes	he	just	stops	here	for	days	and

mebbe	 weeks,	 and	 again	 he’s	 here	 one	 minute	 and	 gone	 the	 next.	 Jumps	 round like	a	flea	on	a	griddle, I	say;	you	can’t	never	tell	nothing	about	what	he’s	going to	do	or	where	he’ll	be	next....	My	land	o’	mercy,	Mr.	Searle!	What	a	start	you

did	give	me!”

The	 man	 had	 succeeded	 in	 startling	 both	 women,	 as	 a	 matter	 of	 fact.	 Eleanor, looking	suddenly	up	from	her	plate	on	hearing	Mrs.	Clover’s	cry	of	surprise,	saw

him	 lounging	 carelessly	 in	 the	 hall	 doorway,	 where	 he	 had	 appeared	 as

noiselessly	 as	 a	 shadow.	 His	 sly,	 satiric	 smile	 was	 twisting	 his	 thin	 lips,	 and	 a sardonic	 humour	 glittered	 in	 the	 pale	 eyes	 that	 shifted	 from	 Eleanor’s	 face	 to Mrs.	Clover’s,	and	back	again.

“I	wish,”	he	said,	nodding	to	the	caretaker,	“you’d	slip	down	to	the	dock	and	tell Eph	to	have	the	boat	ready	by	seven	o’clock.”

“Yes,	 sir,”	 assented	 Mrs.	 Clover	 hastily.	 She	 crossed	 at	 once	 toward	 the	 outer door.	From	her	tone	and	the	alacrity	with	which	she	moved	to	do	his	bidding,	no

less	than	from	the	half-cringing	look	with	which	she	met	his	regard,	Eleanor	had

no	difficulty	in	divining	her	abject	fear	of	this	man	whom	she	could,	apparently,

have	 taken	 in	 her	 big	 hands	 and	 broken	 in	 two	 without	 being	 annoyed	 by	 his

struggles.

“And,	here!”	he	called	after	her—“supper	ready?”

“Yes,	sir—quite.”

“Very	 well;	 I’ll	 have	 mine.	 Eph	 can	 come	 up	 as	 soon	 as	 he’s	 finished

overhauling	 the	 motor.	 Wait	 a	 minute;	 tell	 him	 to	 be	 sure	 to	 bring	 the	 oars	 up with	him.”

“Yes,	sir,	I	will,	sir.”

Mrs.	Clover	dodged	through	the	door	and,	running	down	the	pair	of	steps	from

the	kitchen	stoop	to	the	ground,	vanished	behind	the	house.

“Enjoying	your	breakfast,	I	trust?”

Eleanor	pushed	back	her	chair	and	rose.	She	feared	him,	feared	him	as	she	might

have	feared	any	loathly,	venomous	thing;	but	she	was	not	in	the	least	spiritually

afraid	of	him.	Contempt	and	disgust	only	emphasised	the	quality	of	her	courage.

She	confronted	him	without	a	tremor.

“Will	you	take	me	with	you	when	you	leave	this	island	tonight?”	she	demanded.

He	shook	his	head	with	his	derisive	smile.	She	had	discounted	that	answer.

“How	long	do	you	mean	to	keep	me	here?”

“That	depends	on	how	agreeable	you	make	yourself,”	he	said	obscurely.

“What	do	you	mean?”

“Merely	that	...	well,	it’s	a	pleasant,	salubrious	spot,	Wreck	Island.	You’ll	find	it uncommonly	healthful	and	enjoyable,	too,	as	soon	as	you	get	over	the	loneliness.

Not	 that	 you’ll	 be	 so	 terribly	 lonely;	 I	 shall	 be	 here	 more	 or	 less,	 off	 and	 on, much	 of	 the	 time	 for	 the	 next	 few	 weeks.	 I	 don’t	 mind	 telling	 you,	 in	 strict confidence,	as	between	father	and	child,	that	I’m	planning	to	pull	off	something

pretty	 big	 before	 long;	 of	 course	 it	 will	 need	 a	 bit	 of	 arranging	 in	 advance	 to make	 everything	 run	 smoothly,	 and	 this	 is	 ideal	 for	 a	 man	 of	 my	 retiring disposition,	not	overfond	of	the	espionage	of	his	fellow-men.	So,	if	you’re	docile and	affectionate,	we	may	see	a	great	deal	of	one	another	for	some	weeks—as	I

said.”

“And	if	not—?”

“Well”—he	 waved	 his	 hands	 expressively—“of	 course,	 if	 you	 incline	 to	 be forward	 and	 disobedient,	 then	 I	 shall	 be	 obliged	 to	 deny	 you	 the	 light	 of	 my countenance,	by	way	of	punishment.”

She	shook	her	head	impatiently.	“I	want	to	know	when	you	will	let	me	go,”	she

insisted,	struggling	against	the	oppression	of	her	sense	of	helplessness.

“I	really	can’t	say.”	He	pretended	politely	to	suppress	a	yawn,	indicating	that	the subject	bored	him	inordinately.	“If	I	could	trust	you—”

“Can	you	expect	that,	after	the	way	you	treated	me	last	night—this	morning?”

“Ah,	 well!”	 he	 said,	 claw-like	 fingers	 stroking	 his	 lips	 to	 conceal	 his	 smile	 of mockery.

“You	lied	to	me,	drugged	me,	robbed	me	of	the	necklace,	brought	me	here....”

“Guilty,”	he	said,	yawning	openly.

“Why?	You	could	have	taken	the	necklace	from	me	at	the	hotel.	Why	must	you

bring	me	here	and	keep	me	prisoner?”

“The	pleasure	of	my	only	daughter’s	society....”

“Oh,	you’re	despicable!”	she	cried,	furious.

He	nodded	thoughtfully,	fumbling	with	his	lips.

“Won’t	you	tell	me	why?”	she	pleaded.

He	shook	his	head.	“You	wouldn’t	understand,”	he	added	in	a	tone	of	maddening

commiseration.

“I	shan’t	stay!”	she	declared	angrily.

“Oh,	I	think	you	will,”	he	replied	gently.

“I’ll	get	away	and	inform	on	you	if	I	have	to	swim.”

“It’s	a	long,	wet	swim,”	he	mused	aloud—“over	a	mile,	I	should	say.	Have	you

ever	swum	over	a	hundred	yards	in	your	life?”

She	was	silent,	choking	with	rage.

“And	 furthermore,”	 he	 went	 on,	 “there	 are	 the	 Clovers.	 Excellent	 people, excellent—for	 my	 purposes.	 I	 have	 found	 them	 quite	 invaluable—asking	 no

questions,	minding	their	own	business,	keen	to	obey	my	instructions	to	the	letter.

I	 have	 already	 instructed	 them	 about	 you,	 my	 child.	 I	 trust	 you	 will	 be	 careful not	to	provoke	them;	it’d	be	a	pity	...	you’re	rather	good-looking,	you	know	...”

“What	 do	 you	 mean	 by	 that?”	 she	 stammered,	 a	 little	 frightened	 by	 the	 secret menace	in	his	tone.	“What	have	my	looks	to	do	with	...?”

“Everything,”	he	said	softly—“everything.	Not	so	far	as	Ephraim	is	concerned;

I’ll	 be	 frank	 with	 you—you	 needn’t	 fear	 Ephraim’s	 hurting	 you,	 much,	 should you	attempt	to	escape.	He	will	simply	restrain	you,	using	force	only	if	necessary.

But	 Mrs.	 Clover	 ...	 she’s	 different.	 You	 mustn’t	 let	 her	 deceive	 you;	 she	 seems kindly	 disposed	 enough;	 she’s	 pleasant	 spoken	 but	 ...	 well,	 she’s	 not	 fond	 of pretty	women.	It’s	an	obsession	of	hers	that	prettiness	and	badness	go	together.

And	Ephraim	 is	fond	of	pretty	women—very.	You	see?”

“Well?”

“Well,	that’s	why	I	have	these	people	in	so	strong	a	hold.	You	see,	Ephraim	got

himself	 into	 trouble	 trying	 to	 pull	 off	 one	 of	 those	 bungling,	 amateurish burglaries	 that	 his	 kind	 go	 in	 for	 so	 extensively;	 he	 wanted	 the	 money	 to	 buy things	for	a	pretty	woman.	And	he	was	already	a	married	man.	You	can	see	how

Mrs.	 Clover	 felt	 about	 it.	 She—ah—cut	 up	 rather	 nasty.	 When	 she	 got	 through with	the	other	woman,	no	one	would	have	called	her	pretty	any	longer.	Vitriol’s	a

dreadful	thing....”

He	 paused	 an	 instant,	 seeming	 to	 review	 the	 case	 sombrely.	 “I	 managed	 to	 get them	both	off,	scot	free;	and	that	makes	them	loyal.	But	it	would	go	hard	with

anyone	who	tried	to	escape	to	the	mainland	and	tell	on	them—to	say	nothing	of

me....	 Mrs.	 Clover	 has	 ever	 since	 been	 quite	 convinced	 of	 the	 virtue	 of	 vitriol.

She	 keeps	 a	 supply	 handy	 most	 of	 the	 time,	 in	 case	 of	 emergencies.	 And	 she sleeps	 lightly;	 don’t	 forget	 that.	 I	 hate	 to	 think	 of	 what	 she	 might	 do	 if	 she thought	you	meant	to	run	away	and	tell	tales.”

Slowly,	 step	 by	 step,	 guessing	 the	 way	 to	 the	 outer	 door,	 the	 girl	 backed	 away from	him,	her	face	colourless	with	horror.	Very	probably	he	was	lying	to	frighten

her;	 very	 possibly	 (she	 feared	 desperately)	 he	 was	 not.	 What	 she	 knew	 of	 him was	hardly	reassuring;	the	innate,	callous	depravity	that	had	poisoned	 this	 man

beyond	 cure	 might	 well	 have	 caused	 the	 death-in-life	 of	 other	 souls.	 What	 he was	 capable	 of,	 others	 might	 be;	 and	 what	 she	 knew	 him	 to	 be	 capable	 of,	 she

hardly	 liked	 to	 dwell	 upon.	 Excusably	 she	 conceived	 her	 position	 more	 than desperate;	and	now	her	sole	instinct	was	to	get	away	from	him,	if	only	for	a	little time,	 out	 of	 the	 fœtid	 atmosphere	 of	 his	 presence,	 away	 from	 the	 envenomed irony	of	his	voice—away	and	alone,	where	she	could	recollect	her	faculties	and

again	realise	her	ego,	that	inner	self	that	she	had	tried	so	hard	to	keep	stainless, unspoiled	and	unafraid.

He	 watched	 her	 as	 she	 crept	 inch	 by	 inch	 toward	 the	 door,	 his	 nervous	 fingers busy	about	his	mouth	as	if	trying	to	erase	that	dangerous,	evil	smile.

“Before	you	go,”	he	said	suddenly,	“I	should	tell	you	that	you	will	be	alone	with

Mrs.	Clover	tonight.	I’m	going	to	town,	and	Ephraim’s	to	wait	with	the	boat	at

Pennymint	Point,	because	I	mean	to	return	before	morning.	But	you	needn’t	wait

up	for	me;	Mrs.	Clover	will	do	that.”

Eleanor	made	no	reply.	While	he	was	speaking	she	had	gained	the	door.	As	she

stepped	out,	Mrs.	Clover	reappeared,	making	vigorously	round	the	corner	of	the

house.

Passing	Eleanor	on	the	stoop,	she	gave	her	a	busy,	friendly	nod,	and	hurried	in.

“Eph’ll	 be	 up	 in	 half	 an	 hour,”	 she	 heard	 her	 say.	 “Shall	 I	 serve	 your	 supper now?”

“Please,”	he	said	quietly.

The	girl	stumbled	down	the	steps	and	blindly	fled	the	sound	of	his	voice.





XIV

THE	STRONG-BOX

Her	 initial	 rush	 carried	 Eleanor	 well	 round	 the	 front	 of	 the	 building.	 Then,	 as suddenly	as	she	had	started	off,	she	stopped,	common-sense	reasserting	itself	to

assure	 her	 that	 there	 was	 nothing	 to	 be	 gained	 by	 running	 until	 exhausted;	 her enemy	 was	 not	 pursuing	 her.	 It	 was	 evident	 that	 she	 was	 to	 be	 left	 to	 her	 own devices	as	long	as	they	did	not	impel	her	to	attempt	an	escape—as	long	as	she

made	herself	supple	to	his	will.

She	stood	for	a	long	minute,	very	erect,	head	up	and	shoulders	back,	eyes	closed

and	lips	taut,	her	hands	close-clenched	at	her	sides.	Then	drawing	a	long	breath,

she	 relaxed	 and,	 with	 a	 quiet	 composure	 admirably	 self-enforced,	 moved	 on, setting	herself	to	explore	and	consider	her	surroundings.

The	 abandoned	 hotel	 faced	 the	 south,	 overlooking	 the	 greater	 breadth	 of	 Long Island	Sound.	In	its	era	of	prosperity,	the	land	in	front	of	it	to	the	water’s	edge, and	 indeed	 for	 a	 considerable	 space	 on	 all	 sides	 had	 been	 clear—laid	 out,	 no doubt,	in	grassy	lawns,	croquet	grounds	and	tennis	courts;	but	in	the	long	years

of	its	desuetude	these	had	reverted	to	the	primitive	character	of	the	main	portion of	the	island,	to	a	tangle	of	undergrowth	and	shrubbery	sprinkled	with	scrub-oak

and	 stunted	 pines.	 In	 one	 spot	 only,	 a	 meagre	 kitchen-garden	 was	 under

cultivation.

Southward,	 at	 the	 shore,	 a	 row	 of	 weather-beaten	 and	 ramshackle	 bath-houses stood	 beside	 the	 rotting	 remnants	 of	 a	 long	 dock	 whose	 piles,	 bereft	 of	 their platform	of	planks,	ran	out	into	the	water	in	a	dreary	double	rank.

Westward,	a	patch	of	woodland—progenitor	by	every	characteristic	of	the	tangle

in	 the	 one-time	 clearing—shut	 off	 that	 extremity	 of	 the	 island	 where	 it	 ran	 out into	 a	 sandy	 point.	 Eastward	 lay	 an	 extensive	 acreage	 of	 low,	 rounded	 sand dunes,	 held	 together	 by	 rank	 beach-grass	 and	 bordered	 by	 a	 broad,	 slowly shelving	 beach	 of	 sand	 and	 pebbles.	 To	 the	 north,	 at	 the	 back	 of	 the	 hotel, stretched	a	waste	of	low	ground	finally	merging	into	a	small	salt-marsh.	Across

this	wandered	a	thin	plank	walk	on	stilts	which,	over	the	clear	water	beyond	the

marsh,	 became	 a	 rickety	 landing-stage.	 At	 some	 distance	 out	 from	 the	 latter	 a long,	 slender,	 slate-coloured	 motor-boat	 rode	 at	 its	 moorings,	 a	 rowboat

swinging	 from	 its	 stern.	 In	 the	 larger	 craft	 Eleanor	 could	 see	 the	 head	 and shoulders	of	a	man	bending	over	the	engine—undoubtedly	Mr.	Ephraim	Clover.

While	she	watched	him,	he	straightened	up	and,	going	to	the	stern	of	the	motor-

boat,	 began	 to	 pull	 the	 dory	 in	 by	 its	 painter.	 Having	 brought	 it	 alongside,	 he transshipped	 himself	 awkwardly,	 then	 began	 to	 drive	 the	 dory	 in	 to	 the	 dock.

Eleanor	 remarked	 the	 fact	 that	 he	 stood	 up	 to	 the	 task,	 propelling	 the	 boat	 by means	of	a	single	oar,	thrusting	it	into	the	water	until	it	struck	bottom	and	then putting	 his	 weight	 upon	 it.	 The	 water	 was	 evidently	 quite	 shallow;	 even	 where the	motor-boat	lay	moored,	the	oar	disappeared	no	more	than	half	its	length.

Presently,	having	gained	the	landing-stage,	the	man	clambered	upon	it,	threw	a

couple	of	half-hitches	in	the	painter	round	one	of	the	stakes,	shouldered	the	oars and	began	to	shamble	toward	the	hotel:	a	tall,	ungainly	figure	blackly	silhouetted against	the	steel-blue	sky	of	evening.

Eleanor	 waited	 where	 she	 was,	 near	 the	 beginning	 of	 the	 plank	 walk,	 to	 get	 a better	look	at	him.	In	time	he	passed	her,	with	a	shy	nod	and	sidelong	glance.	He

seemed	 to	 be	 well	 past	 middle-age,	 of	 no	 pretensions	 whatever	 to	 physical loveliness	and	(she	would	have	said)	incurably	lazy	and	stupid:	his	face	dull	and

heavy,	his	whole	carriage	eloquent	of	a	nature	of	sluggish	shiftlessness.

He	 disappeared	 round	 the	 house,	 and	 a	 moment	 later	 she	 heard	 Mrs.	 Clover haranguing	him	in	a	shrill	voice	of	impatience	little	resembling	the	tone	she	had

employed	with	the	girl.

For	 an	 instant	 Eleanor	 dreamed	 wildly	 of	 running	 down	 to	 the	 dock,	 throwing herself	into	the	rowboat	and	casting	it	off	to	drift	whither	it	would.	But	the	folly of	 this	 was	 too	 readily	 apparent;	 even	 if	 she	 might	 be	 sure	 that	 the	 tide	 would carry	her	away	from	the	island,	the	water	was	so	shallow	that	a	man	could	wade

out	to	the	motor-boat,	climb	into	it	and	run	her	down	with	discouraging	ease.	As

for	the	motor-boat—she	hadn’t	the	least	idea	of	the	art	of	running	a	motor;	and

besides,	 she	 would	 be	 overhauled	 before	 she	 could	 get	 to	 it;	 for	 she	 made	 no doubt	whatever	that	she	was	being	very	closely	watched,	and	would	be	until	the

men	had	left	the	island.	After	that	...	a	vista	of	days	of	grinding	loneliness	and hopeless	despair	opened	out	before	her	disheartened	mental	vision.

She	resumed	her	aimless	tour	of	inspection,	little	caring	whither	she	wandered	so

long	as	it	was	far	from	the	house,	as	far	as	possible	from	... him.

Sensibly	the	desolate	spirit	of	the	spot	saturated	her	mood.	No	case	that	she	had

ever	 heard	 of	 seemed	 to	 her	 so	 desperate	 as	 that	 of	 the	 lonely,	 helpless	 girl

marooned	upon	this	wave-bound	patch	of	earth	and	sand,	cut	off	from	all	means of	 communication	 with	 her	 kind,	 her	 destiny	 at	 the	 disposal	 of	 the	 maleficent wretch	who	called	himself	her	father,	her	sole	companions	two	alleged	criminals

whose	depravity,	if	what	she	had	heard	were	true,	was	subordinate	only	to	his.

She	could	have	wept,	but	wouldn’t;	the	emotion	that	oppressed	her	was	not	one

that	tears	would	soothe,	her	plight	not	one	that	tears	could	mend.

Her	sole	comfort	resided	in	the	fact	that	she	was	apparently	to	be	let	alone,	free to	wander	at	will	within	the	boundaries	of	the	island.

Sunset	found	her	on	a	little	sandy	hillock	at	the	western	end	of	Wreck	Island—

sitting	 with	 her	 chin	 in	 her	 hands,	 and	 gazing	 seawards	 with	 eyes	 in	 which rebellion	 smouldered.	 She	 would	 not	 give	 in,	 would	 not	 abandon	 hope	 and accept	the	situation	at	its	face	value,	as	irremediable.	Upon	this	was	she	firmly

determined:	the	night	was	not	to	pass	unmarked	by	some	manner	of	attempt	to

escape	or	summon	aid.	She	even	found	herself	willing	to	consider	arson	as	a	last

resort:	 the	 hotel	 afire	 would	 make	 a	 famous	 torch	 to	 bring	 assistance	 from	 the mainland.	 Only	 ...	 she	 shrank	 from	 the	 attempt,	 her	 soul	 curdling	 with	 the sinister	menace	of	vitriol.

The	day	was	dying	in	soft	airs	that	swept	the	face	of	the	waters	with	a	touch	so

light	 as	 to	 be	 barely	 perceptible.	 With	 sundown	 fell	 stark	 calm;	 the	 Sound became	a	perfect	mirror	for	the	sombre	conflagration	in	the	west.	The	slightest

sounds	 reverberated	 afar	 through	 the	 still,	 moveless	 void.	 She	 could	 hear	 Mrs.

Clover	 stridently	 counselling	 her	 Ephraim	 at	 the	 house,	 the	 quarter	 of	 a	 mile away.	Later,	she	heard	the	hollow	tramp	of	two	pair	of	feet,	one	heavy	and	one

light,	on	the	plank-walk;	the	creak	of	rowlocks	with	the	dip	and	splash	of	oars;

and,	after	a	little	pause,	the	sudden,	sharp,	explosive	rattle	of	a	motor	exhaust,	as rapid,	 loud	 and	 staccato	 as	 the	 barking	 of	 a	 Gatling,	 yet	 quickly	 hushed——

almost	 as	 soon	 as	 it	 shattered	 the	 silences,	 muffled	 to	 a	 thick	 and	 steady drumming.

Eleanor	rose	and	turned	to	look	northward.	The	wood-lot	hid	from	her	sight	both

dock	 and	 mooring—and	 all	 but	 the	 gables	 of	 the	 hotel,	 as	 well—but	 she	 soon espied	 the	 motor-boat	 standing	 away	 on	 a	 straight	 course	 for	 the	 mainland: driven	at	a	speed	that	seemed	to	her	nearly	incredible,	a	smother	of	foam	at	its

stern,	long	purple	ripples	widening	away	from	the	jet	of	white	water	at	the	stem,

a	 smooth,	 high	 swell	 of	 dark	 water	 pursuing	 as	 if	 it	 meant	 to	 catch	 up	 and overwhelm	the	boat	and	its	occupants.	These	latter	occupied	the	extremes	of	the

little	vessel:	Ephraim	astern,	beside	the	motor;	the	slighter	figure	at	the	wheel	in the	bows.

Slowly	 the	 girl	 took	 her	 path	 back	 to	 the	 hotel,	 watching	 the	 boat	 draw	 away, straight	 and	 swift	 of	 flight	 as	 an	 arrow,	 momentarily	 dwindling	 and	 losing definite	form	against	the	deepening	blue-black	surface	of	the	Sound....

Weary	and	despondent,	she	ascended	the	pair	of	steps	to	the	kitchen	porch.	Mrs.

Clover	 was	 busy	 within,	 washing	 the	 supper	 dishes.	 She	 called	 out	 a	 cheery greeting,	to	which	Eleanor	responded	briefly	but	with	as	pleasant	a	tone	as	she

could	muster.	She	could	not	but	distrust	her	companion	and	gaoler,	could	not	but

fear	 that	 something	 vile	 and	 terrible	 lurked	 beneath	 that	 good-natured

semblance:	else	why	need	the	woman	have	become	 his	creature?

“You	ain’t	hungry	again?”

“No,”	said	Eleanor,	lingering	on	the	porch,	reluctant	to	enter.

“Lonely?”

“No....”

“You	needn’t	be;	your	pa’ll	be	home	by	three	o’clock,	he	says.”

Eleanor	said	nothing.	 Abruptly	a	thought	 had	entered	her	 mind,	bringing	 hope;

something	she	had	almost	forgotten	had	recurred	with	tremendous	significance.

“Tired?	I’ll	go	fix	up	your	room	soon	’s	I’m	done	here,	if	you	want	to	lay	down

again.”

“No;	I’m	in	no	hurry.	I—I	think	I’ll	go	for	another	little	walk	round	the	island.”

“Help	yourself,”	the	woman	called	after	her	heartily;	“I’ll	be	busy	for	about	half an	hour,	and	then	we	can	take	our	chairs	out	on	the	porch	and	watch	the	moon

come	up	and	have	a	real	good,	old-fashioned	gossip....”

Eleanor	lost	the	sound	of	her	voice	as	she	turned	swiftly	back	round	the	house.

Then	she	stopped,	catching	her	breath	with	delight.	It	was	true—splendidly	true!

The	rowboat	had	been	left	behind.

It	rode	about	twenty	yards	out	from	the	end	of	the	dock,	made	fast	to	the	motor-

boat	 mooring.	 The	 oars	 were	 in	 it;	 Ephraim	 had	 left	 them	 carelessly	 disposed, their	blades	projecting	a	little	beyond	the	stern.	And	the	water	was	so	shallow	at

the	mooring	that	the	man	had	been	able	to	pole	in	with	a	single	oar,	immersing	it but	 half	 its	 length!	 An	 oar,	 she	 surmised,	 was	 six	 feet	 long;	 that	 argued	 an extreme	 depth	 of	 water	 of	 three	 feet—say	 at	 the	 worst	 three	 and	 a	 half.	 Surely she	 might	 dare	 to	 wade	 out,	 unmoor	 the	 boat	 and	 climb	 in—if	 but	 opportunity were	granted	her!

But	her	heart	sank	as	she	considered	the	odds	against	any	such	attempt.	If	only

the	 night	 were	 to	 be	 dark;	 if	 only	 Mrs.	 Clover	 were	 not	 to	 wait	 up	 for	 her husband	and	her	employer;	if	only	the	woman	were	not	her	superior	physically,

so	strong	that	Eleanor	would	be	like	a	child	in	her	hands;	if	only	there	were	not

that	awful	threat	of	vitriol	...!

Nevertheless,	in	the	face	of	these	frightful	deterrents,	she	steeled	her	resolution.

Whatever	the	consequences,	she	owed	it	to	herself	to	be	vigilant	for	her	chance.

She	 promised	 herself	 to	 be	 wakeful	 and	 watchful:	 possibly	 Mrs.	 Clover	 might nap	while	sitting	up;	and	the	girl	had	two	avenues	by	which	to	leave	the	house:

either	 through	 the	 kitchen,	 or	 by	 the	 front	 door	 to	 the	 disused	 portion	 of	 the hotel.	She	need	only	steal	noiselessly	along	the	corridor	from	her	bedroom	door

and	down	the	broad	main	staircase	and—the	front	door	was	not	even	locked.	She

remembered	distinctly	that	 he	had	simply	pulled	it	to.	Still,	it	would	be	well	to make	certain	he	had	not	gone	back	later	to	lock	it.

Strolling	 idly,	 with	 a	 casual	 air	 of	 utter	 ennui—assumed	 for	 the	 benefit	 of	 her gaoler	in	event	she	should	become	inquisitive—Eleanor	went	round	the	eastern

end	of	the	building	to	the	front.	Here	a	broad	veranda	ran	from	wing	to	wing;	its

rotting	 weather-eaten	 floor	 fenced	 in	 by	 a	 dilapidated	 railing	 save	 where	 steps led	 up	 to	 the	 front	 door;	 its	 roof	 caved	 in	 at	 one	 spot,	 wearing	 a	 sorry	 look	 of baldness	in	others	where	whole	tiers	of	shingles	had	fallen	away.

Cautiously	 Eleanor	 mounted	 the	 rickety	 steps	 and	 crossed	 to	 the	 doors.	 To	 her delight,	they	opened	readily	to	a	turn	of	the	knob.	She	stood	for	a	trifle,	hesitant, peering	into	the	hallway	now	dark	with	evening	shadow;	then	curiosity	overbore

her	reluctance.	There	was	nothing	to	fear;	the	voice	of	Mrs.	Clover	singing	over

her	 dishpan	 in	 the	 kitchen	 came	 clearly	 through	 the	 ground-floor	 corridor, advertising	plainly	her	preoccupation.	And	Eleanor	wanted	desperately	to	know

what	it	was	that	the	man	had	hidden	in	the	socket	of	the	newel-post.

Shutting	 the	 door	 she	 felt	 her	 way	 step	 by	 step	 to	 the	 foot	 of	 the	 staircase.

Happily	the	floor	was	sound:	no	creaking	betrayed	her	progress—there	would	be

none	when	in	the	dead	of	night	she	would	break	for	freedom.

Mrs.	Clover	continued	to	sing	contentedly.

Eleanor	 removed	 the	 knob	 of	 the	 post	 and	 looked	 down	 into	 the	 socket.	 It	 was dark	in	there;	she	could	 see	 nothing;	 so	 she	 inserted	 her	 hand	 and	 groped	 until her	fingers	closed	upon	a	thick	rough	bar	of	metal.	Removing	this,	she	found	she

held	a	cumbersome	old-fashioned	iron	key	of	curious	design.

It	puzzled	her	a	little	until	she	recalled	the	clang	of	metal	that	had	prefaced	the man’s	appearance	in	the	hall	that	afternoon.	This	then,	she	inferred,	would	be	the key	to	his	private	cache—the	secret	spot	where	he	hid	his	loot	between	forays.

Mrs.	Clover	stopped	singing	suddenly,	and	the	girl	in	panic	returned	the	key	to

its	hiding	place,	the	knob	to	its	socket.

But	it	had	been	a	false	alarm.	In	another	moment	the	woman’s	voice	was	again

upraised.

Eleanor	considered,	staring	about	her.	He	had	come	into	sight	from	beneath	the

staircase.	She	reconnoitred	stealthily	in	that	direction,	and	discovered	a	portion of	 the	 hall	 fenced	 off	 by	 a	 railing	 and	 counter:	 evidently	 the	 erstwhile	 hotel office.	 A	 door	 stood	 open	 behind	 the	 counter.	 With	 some	 slight	 qualms	 she passed	into	the	enclosure	and	then	through	the	door.

She	 found	 herself	 in	 a	 small,	 stuffy,	 dark	 room.	 Its	 single	 window,	 looking northwards,	was	closely	shuttered	on	the	outside;	only	a	feeble	twilight	filtered

through	the	slanted	slats.	But	there	was	light	enough	for	Eleanor	to	recognise	the contours	 and	 masses	 of	 a	 flat-topped	 desk	 with	 two	 pedestals	 of	 drawers,	 a revolving	 chair	 with	 cane	 seat	 and	 back,	 a	 brown	 paper-pulp	 cuspidor	 of generous	proportions	and—a	huge,	solid,	antiquated	iron	safe:	a	“strong-box”	of

the	 last	 century’s	 middle	 decades,	 substantial	 as	 a	 rock,	 tremendously	 heavy, contemptuously	 innocent	 of	 any	 such	 innovations	 as	 combination-dials,	 time-locks	and	the	like.	A	single	keyhole,	almost	large	enough	to	admit	a	child’s	hand, and	 certainly	 calculated	 to	 admit	 the	 key	 in	 the	 newel-post,	 demonstrated	 that this	 safe	 depended	 for	 the	 security	 of	 its	 contents	 upon	 nothing	 more	 than	 its massive	 construction	 and	 unwieldy	 lock.	 It	 demonstrated	 something	 more:	 that its	 owner	 based	 his	 confidence	 upon	 its	 isolation	 and	 the	 loyalty	 of	 his employees,	 or	 else	 had	 satisfied	 himself	 through	 practical	 experiment	 that	 one safe	 was	 as	 good	 as	 another,	 ancient	 or	 modern,	 when	 subjected	 to	 the	 test	 of modern	methods	of	burglary.

And	(Eleanor	was	sure)	the	Cadogan	collar	was	there;	unless,	of	course,	the	man

had	 taken	 it	 away	 with	 him;	 which	 didn’t	 seem	 likely,	 all	 things	 considered.	 A great	 part	 of	 the	 immense	 value	 of	 the	 necklace	 resided	 in	 its	 perfection,	 in	 its integrity;	as	a	whole	it	would	be	an	exceedingly	difficult	thing	to	dispose	of	until long	after	the	furore	aroused	by	its	disappearance	had	died	down;	broken	up,	its

marvellously	matched	pearls	separated	and	sold	one	by	one,	it	would	not	realise

a	third	of	its	worth.

And	the	girl	would	have	known	the	truth	in	five	minutes	more	(she	was,	in	fact,

already	 moving	 back	 toward	 the	 newel-post)	 had	 not	 Mrs.	 Clover	 chosen	 that moment	to	leave	the	kitchen	and	tramp	noisily	down	the	corridor.

What	her	business	might	be	in	that	part	of	the	house	Eleanor	could	not	imagine

—unless	 it	 were	 connected	 with	 herself,	 unless	 she	 had	 heard	 some	 sound	 and was	coming	to	investigate.

In	 panic	 terror,	 Eleanor	 turned	 back	 into	 the	 little	 room	 and	 crouched	 down behind	the	safe,	making	herself	as	small	as	possible,	actually	holding	her	breath

for	fear	it	would	betray	her.

Nearer	came	that	steady,	unhurried	tread,	and	nearer.	The	girl	thought	her	heart

would	burst	with	its	burden	of	suspense.	She	was	obliged	to	gasp	for	breath,	and

the	 noise	 of	 it	 rang	 as	 loudly	 and	 hoarsely	 in	 her	 hearing	 as	 the	 exhaust	 of	 a steam-engine.	She	pressed	a	handkerchief	against	her	trembling	lips.

Directly	to	the	counter	came	the	footsteps,	and	paused.	There	was	the	thump	of

something	being	placed	upon	the	shelf.	Then	deliberately	the	woman	turned	and

marched	back	to	her	quarters.

In	time	the	girl	managed	to	regain	enough	control	of	her	nerves	to	enable	her	to

rise	 and	 creep	 out	 through	 the	 office	 enclosure	 to	 the	 hall.	 Mrs.	 Clover	 had resumed	her	chanting	in	the	kitchen;	but	Eleanor	was	in	no	mood	to	run	further

chances	 just	 then.	 She	 needed	 to	 get	 away,	 to	 find	 time	 to	 compose	 herself thoroughly.	 Pausing	 only	 long	 enough	 to	 see	 for	 herself	 what	 the	 woman	 had deposited	on	the	counter	(it	was	a	common	oil	lamp,	newly	filled	and	trimmed,

with	 a	 box	 of	 matches	 beside	 it:	 preparations,	 presumably,	 against	 the	 home-coming	 of	 the	 master	 with	 a	 fresh	 consignment	 of	 booty)	 she	 flitted	 swiftly	 to and	through	the	door,	closed	it	and	ran	down	the	steps	to	the	honest,	kindly	earth.

Here	she	was	safe.	None	suspected	her	adventure	or	her	discovery.	She	quieted

from	 her	 excitement,	 and	 for	 a	 long	 time	 paced	 slowly	 to	 and	 fro,	 pondering ways	and	means.

The	fire	ebbed	from	the	heart	of	the	western	sky;	twilight	merged	imperceptibly into	 a	 night	 extraordinarily	 clear	 and	 luminous	 with	 the	 gentle	 radiance	 of	 a wonderful	pageant	of	stars.	The	calm	held	unbroken.	The	barking	of	a	dog	on	the

mainland	carried,	thin	but	sharp,	across	the	waters.	On	the	Sound,	lights	moved

sedately	 east	 and	 west:	 red	 lights	 and	 green	 and	 white	 lancing	 the	 waters	 with long	 quivering	 blades.	 At	 times	 the	 girl	 heard	 voices	 of	 men	 talking	 at	 a	 great distance.	Once	a	passenger	steamer	crept	out	of	the	west,	seeming	to	quicken	its

pace	as	it	drew	abreast	the	island,	then	swept	on	and	away	like	a	floating	palace

of	 fairy	 lamps.	 As	 it	 passed,	 the	 strains	 of	 its	 string	 orchestra	 sounded	 softly clear	 through	 the	 night.	 Other	 steamers	 followed—half	 a	 dozen	 in	 a	 widely spaced	 procession.	 But	 no	 boat	 came	 near	 Wreck	 Island.	 If	 one	 had,	 Eleanor could	almost	have	found	courage	to	call	for	help....

In	 due	 time	 Mrs.	 Clover	 hunted	 her	 up,	 bringing	 a	 lantern	 to	 guide	 her	 heavy footsteps.

“Lands	sakes!”	she	cried,	catching	sight	of	the	girl.	“Wherever	have	you	been	all

this	time?”

“Just	walking	up	and	down,”	said	Eleanor	quietly.

“Thank	goodness	I	found	you,”	the	woman	panted.	“Give	me	quite	a	turn,	you

did. I	didn’t	know	but	what	you	might	be	trying	some	foolish	idea	about	leaving us,	 like	 your	 pa	 said	 you	 might.	 One	 never	 knows	 when	 to	 trust	 you	 nervous prostrationists,	or	what	you’ll	be	up	to	next.”

Eleanor	 glanced	 at	 her	 sharply,	 wondering	 if	 by	 any	 chance	 the	 woman’s	 mind could	 be	 as	 guileless	 as	 her	 words	 or	 the	 bland	 and	 childish	 simplicity	 of	 her eyes	in	the	lantern-light.

“Wish	 you’d	 come	 up	 on	 the	 stoop	 and	 keep	 me	 company,”	 continued	 Mrs.

Clover;	“I’m	plumb	tired	of	sitting	round	all	alone.	Moon’ll	be	up	before	long;

it’s	a	purty	sight,	shining	on	the	water.”

“Thank	 you,”	 said	 Eleanor;	 “I’m	 afraid	 I’m	 too	 tired.	 It	 must	 be	 later	 than	 I thought.	If	you	don’t	mind	I’ll	go	to	my	room.”

“Oh,	 please	 yourself,”	 said	 the	 woman,	 disappointment	 lending	 her	 tone	 an unpleasant	edge.	“You’ll	find	it	hot	and	stuffy	up	there,	though.	If	you	can’t	get comfortable,	come	down-stairs;	I’ll	be	up	till	the	boss	gets	home.”

“Very	well,”	said	Eleanor.

She	said	good	night	to	Mrs.	Clover	on	the	kitchen	porch	and	going	to	her	room, threw	herself	upon	the	bed,	dressed	as	she	was.

For	 some	 time	 the	 woman	 down-stairs	 rocked	 slowly	 on	 the	 porch,	 humming sonorously.	 The	 sound	 was	 infinitely	 soothing.	 Eleanor	 had	 some	 difficulty	 in keeping	 awake,	 and	 only	 managed	 to	 do	 so	 by	 dint	 of	 continually	 exciting	 her imagination	 with	 thoughts	 of	 the	 Cadogan	 collar	 in	 the	 safe,	 the	 key	 in	 the newel-post,	 the	 dory	 swinging	 at	 its	 moorings	 in	 water	 little	 more	 than	 waist deep....

In	spite	of	all	this,	she	did	as	the	slow	hours	lagged	drift	into	a	half-waking	nap.

How	long	it	lasted	she	couldn’t	guess	when	she	wakened;	but	it	had	not	been	too

long;	a	glance	at	the	dial	of	her	wrist-watch	in	a	slant	of	moonlight	through	the

window	 reassured	 her	 as	 to	 the	 flight	 of	 time.	 It	 was	 nearly	 midnight;	 she	 had three	hours	left,	three	hours	leeway	before	the	return	of	her	persecutor.

She	lay	without	moving,	listening	attentively.	The	house	was	anything	but	still;

ghosts	 of	 forgotten	 footsteps	 haunted	 all	 its	 stairs	 and	 corridors;	 but	 the	 girl could	 hear	 no	 sound	 ascribable	 to	 human	 agency.	 Mrs.	 Clover	 no	 longer	 sang, her	rocking-chair	no	longer	creaked.

With	 infinite	 precautions	 she	 got	 up	 and	 slipped	 out	 of	 the	 room.	 Once	 in	 the hallway	 she	 did	 hear	 a	 noise	 of	 which	 she	 easily	 guessed	 the	 source;	 and	 the choiring	 of	 angels	 could	 have	 been	 no	 more	 sweet	 in	 her	 hearing:	 Mrs.	 Clover was	snoring.

Kneeling	 at	 the	 head	 of	 the	 staircase	 and	 bending	 over,	 with	 an	 arm	 round	 the banister	 for	 support,	 she	 could	 see	 a	 portion	 of	 the	 kitchen.	 And	 what	 she	 saw only	 confirmed	 the	 testimony	 of	 the	 snores.	 The	 woman	 had	 moved	 indoors	 to read;	an	oil	lamp	stood	by	her	shoulder,	on	the	table;	her	chair	was	well	tilted,

her	head	resting	against	its	back;	an	old	magazine	lay	open	on	her	lap;	her	chin

had	fallen;	from	her	mouth	issued	dissonant	chords	of	contentment.

Eleanor	 drew	 back,	 rose	 and	 felt	 her	 way	 to	 the	 long	 corridor.	 Down	 this	 she stole	 as	 silently	 as	 any	 ghost,	 wholly	 indifferent	 to	 the	 eerie	 influences	 of	 the desolate	place,	spectrally	illuminated	as	it	was	with	faded	chequers	of	moonlight

falling	through	dingy	windows,	alive	as	it	was	with	the	groans	and	complaints	of

uneasy	planks	and	timbers	and	the	 frou-frou,	like	that	of	silken	skirts,	of	rats	and mice	scuttling	between	its	flimsy	walls.	These	counted	for	nothing	to	her;	but	all her	soul	hung	on	the	continuance	of	that	noise	of	snoring	in	the	kitchen;	and	time and	 again	 she	 paused	 and	 listened,	 breathless,	 until	 sure	 it	 was	 holding	 on

without	interruption.

Gaining	 at	 length	 the	 head	 of	 the	 stairs,	 she	 picked	 her	 way	 down	 very	 gently, her	 heart	 thumping	 madly	 as	 the	 burden	 of	 her	 weight	 wrung	 from	 each

individual	 step	 its	 personal	 protest,	 loud	 enough	 (she	 felt)	 to	 wake	 the	 dead	 in their	 graves;	 but	 not	 loud	 enough,	 it	 seemed,	 to	 disturb	 the	 slumbers	 of	 the excellent,	if	untrustworthy,	Mrs.	Clover.

At	length	she	had	gained	the	newel-post	and	abstracted	the	key.	The	foretaste	of

success	 was	 sweet.	 Pausing	 only	 long	 enough	 to	 unlatch	 the	 front	 door,	 for escape	 in	 emergency,	 she	 darted	 through	 the	 hall,	 behind	 the	 counter,	 into	 the little	room.

And	still	Mrs.	Clover	slept	aloud.

Kneeling,	 Eleanor	 fitted	 the	 key	 to	 the	 lock.	 Happily,	 it	 was	 well	 oiled	 and	 in excellent	working	order.	The	 tumblers	 gave	 to	 the	 insistence	 of	 the	 wards	 with the	softest	of	dull	clicks.	She	grasped	the	handle,	and	the	heavy	door	swung	wide

without	a	murmur.

And	 then	 she	 paused,	 at	 a	 loss.	 It	 was	 densely	 dark	 in	 the	 little	 room,	 and	 she required	 to	 be	 able	 to	 see	 what	 she	 was	 about,	 if	 she	 were	 to	 pick	 out	 the Cadogan	collar.

It	 was	 risky,	 a	 hazardous	 chance,	 but	 she	 determined	 to	 run	 it.	 The	 lamp	 that Mrs.	Clover	had	left	for	her	employer	was	too	convenient	to	be	rejected.	Eleanor

brought	it	into	the	room,	carefully	shut	the	door	to	prevent	the	light	being	visible from	 the	 hall,	 should	 Mrs.	 Clover	 wake	 and	 miss	 her,	 placed	 the	 lamp	 on	 the floor	before	the	safe	and	lighted	it.

As	 its	 soft	 illumination	 disclosed	 the	 interior	 of	 the	 antiquated	 strong-box,	 the girl	 uttered	 a	 low	 cry	 of	 dismay.	 To	 pick	 out	 what	 she	 sought	 from	 that accumulation	(even	if	it	were	really	there)	would	be	the	work	of	hours—barring

a	most	happy	and	unlikely	stroke	of	fortune.

The	 interior	 of	 the	 safe	 was	 divided	 into	 some	 twelve	 pigeon-holes,	 all	 closely packed	with	parcels	of	various	sizes—brown-paper	parcels,	neatly	wrapped	and

tied	 with	 cord,	 each	 as	 neatly	 labelled	 in	 ink	 with	 an	 indecipherable

hieroglyphic:	 presumably	 a	 means	 of	 identification	 to	 one	 intimate	 with	 the code.

She	turned	in	time	to	see	the	door	open	and	the	face	and	figure	of	her	father

Page	274

But	Eleanor	possessed	no	means	of	telling	one	package	from	another;	they	were

all	so	similar	to	one	another	in	everything	save	size,	in	which	they	differed	only slightly,	hardly	materially.

None	 the	 less,	 having	 dared	 so	 much,	 she	 wasn’t	 of	 the	 stuff	 to	 give	 up	 the attempt	without	at	least	a	little	effort	to	find	what	she	sought.	And	impulsively

she	 selected	 the	 first	 package	 that	 fell	 under	 her	 hand,	 with	 nervous	 fingers unwrapped	 it	 and—found	 herself	 admiring	 an	 extremely	 handsome	 diamond

brooch.

As	if	it	had	been	a	handful	of	pebbles,	she	cast	it	from	her	to	blaze	despised	upon the	mean	plank	flooring,	and	selected	another	package.

It	contained	rings—three	gold	rings	set	with	solitaire	diamonds.	They	shared	the

fate	of	the	brooch.

The	next	packet	held	a	watch.	This,	too,	she	dropped	contemptuously,	hurrying

on.

She	 had	 no	 method,	 other	 than	 to	 take	 the	 uppermost	 packets	 from	 each

pigeonhole,	 on	 the	 theory	 that	 the	 necklace	 had	 been	 one	 of	 the	 last	 articles entrusted	 to	 the	 safe.	 And	 that	 there	 was	 some	 sense	 in	 this	 method	 was demonstrated	when	she	opened	the	ninth	package—or	possibly	the	twelfth:	she

was	too	busy	and	excited	to	keep	any	sort	of	count.

This	last	packet,	however,	revealed	the	Cadogan	collar.

With	a	little,	thankful	sigh	the	girl	secreted	the	thing	in	the	bosom	of	her	dress and	prepared	to	rise.

Behind	her	a	board	creaked	and	the	doorlatch	clicked.	Still	sitting—heart	in	her

mouth,	breath	at	a	standstill,	blood	chilling	with	fright—she	turned	in	time	to	see the	door	open	and	the	face	and	figure	of	her	father	as	he	stood	looking	down	at

her,	his	eyes	blinking	in	the	glare	of	light	that	painted	a	gleam	along	the	polished barrel	of	the	weapon	in	his	hand.





XV

THE	ENEMY’S	HAND

In	 spite	 of	 the	 somewhat	 abrupt	 and	 cavalier	 fashion	 in	 which	 Staff	 had	 parted from	Alison	at	the	St.	Simon,	he	was	obliged	to	meet	her	again	that	afternoon	at

the	offices	of	Jules	Max,	to	discuss	and	select	the	cast	for	 A	Single	Woman.	The memory	which	each	 retained	of	their	 earlier	meeting	naturally	 rankled,	and	the

amenities	suffered	proportionately.	In	justice	to	Staff	it	must	be	set	down	that	he wasn’t	 the	 aggressor;	 his	 contract	 with	 Max	 stipulated	 that	 he	 should	 have	 the deciding	word	in	the	selection	of	the	cast—aside	from	the	leading	rôle,	of	course

—and	when	Alison	chose,	as	she	invariably	did,	to	try	to	usurp	that	function,	the

author	merely	stood	calmly	and	with	imperturbable	courtesy	upon	his	rights.	In

consequence,	it	was	Alison	who	made	the	conference	so	stormy	a	one	that	Max

more	than	once	threatened	to	tear	his	hair,	and	as	a	matter	of	fact	did	make	futile grabs	at	the	meagre	fringe	surrounding	his	bald	spot.	So	the	meeting	inevitably

ended	in	an	armed	truce,	with	no	business	accomplished:	Staff	offering	to	release

Max	 from	 his	 contract	 to	 produce,	 the	 manager	 frantically	 begging	 him	 to	 do nothing	of	the	sort,	and	Alison	making	vague	but	disquieting	remarks	about	her

inclination	to	“rest.”	...

Staff	dined	alone,	with	disgust	of	his	trade	for	a	sauce	to	his	food.	And,	being	a man—which	is	as	much	as	to	say,	a	creature	without	much	real	understanding	of

his	own	private	emotional	existence—he	wagged	his	head	in	solemn	amazement

because	he	had	once	thought	he	could	love	a	woman	like	that.

Now	Eleanor	Searle	was	a	different	sort	of	a	girl	altogether....

Not	that	he	had	any	right	to	think	of	her	in	that	light;	only,	Alison	had	chosen	to seem	 jealous	 of	 the	 girl.	 Heaven	 alone	 (he	 called	 it	 honestly	 to	 witness)	 knew why....

Not	that	 he	cared	whether	Alison	were	jealous	or	not....

But	 he	 was	 surprised	 at	 his	 solicitude	 for	 Miss	 Searle—now	 that	 Alison	 had made	 him	 think	 of	 her.	 He	 was	 really	 more	 anxious	 about	 her	 than	 he	 had suspected.	 She	 had	 seemed	 to	 like	 him,	 the	 few	 times	 they’d	 met;	 and	 he	 had liked	her	very	well	indeed;	it’s	refreshing	to	meet	a	woman	in	whom	beauty	and

sensibility	are	combined;	the	combination’s	piquant,	when	you	come	to	consider how	uncommon	it	is....

He	didn’t	believe	for	an	instant	that	she	had	meant	to	run	away	with	the	Cadogan

collar;	 and	 he	 hoped	 fervently	 that	 she	 hadn’t	 been	 involved	 in	 any	 serious trouble	 by	 the	 qualified	 thing.	 Furthermore,	 he	 candidly	 wished	 he	 might	 be permitted	 to	 help	 extricate	 her,	 if	 she	 were	 really	 tangled	 up	 in	 any

unpleasantness.

Such,	 at	 all	 events,	 was	 the	 general	 tone	 of	 his	 meditations	 throughout	 dinner and	his	homeward	stroll	down	Fifth	Avenue	from	Forty-fourth	Street,	a	stroll	in

which	he	cast	himself	for	the	part	of	the	misprized	hero;	and	made	himself	look

it	 to	 the	 life	 by	 sticking	 his	 hands	 in	 his	 pockets,	 carrying	 his	 cane	 at	 a despondent	 angle	 beneath	 one	 arm,	 resting	 his	 chin	 on	 his	 chest—or	 as	 nearly there	as	was	practicable,	if	he	cared	to	escape	being	strangled	by	his	collar—and

permitting	a	cigarette	to	dangle	dejectedly	from	his	lips....

He	arrived	in	front	of	his	lodgings	at	nine	o’clock	or	something	later.	And	as	he

started	up	the	brownstone	stoop	he	became	aware	of	a	disconsolate	little	figure

hunched	up	on	the	topmost	step;	which	was	Mr.	Iff.

The	little	man	had	his	chin	in	his	hands	and	his	hat	pulled	down	over	his	eyes.

He	rose	as	Staff	came	up	the	steps	and	gave	him	good	evening	in	a	spiritless	tone

which	he	promptly	remedied	by	the	acid	observation:

“It’s	 a	 pity	 you	 wouldn’t	 try	 to	 be	 home	 when	 I	 call.	 Here	 you’ve	 kept	 me waiting	the	best	part	of	an	hour.”

“Sorry,”	 said	 Staff	 gravely;	 “but	 why	 stand	 on	 ceremony	 at	 this	 late	 day?	 My bedroom	 windows	 are	 still	 open;	 I	 left	 ’em	 so,	 fancying	 you	 might	 prefer	 to come	in	that	way.”

“It’s	a	pity,”	commented	Iff,	following	him	upstairs,	“you	can’t	do	something	for

that	oratorical	weakness	of	yours.	Ever	try	choking	it	down?	Or	would	that	make

you	ill?”

With	which	he	 seemed	content	to	 abandon	persiflage,	satisfied	 that	his	average

for	 acerbity	 was	 still	 high.	 “Besides,”	 he	 said	 peaceably,	 “I’m	 all	 dressed	 up pretty	 now,	 and	 it	 doesn’t	 look	 right	 for	 a	 respectable	 member	 of	 society	 to	 be pulling	off	second-story	man	stunts.”

Staff	led	him	into	the	study,	turned	on	the	lights,	then	looked	his	guest	over.

So	 far	 as	 his	 person	 was	 involved,	 it	 was	 evident	 that	 Iff	 had	 employed	 Staff’s American	 money	 to	 advantage.	 He	 wore,	 with	 the	 look	 of	 one	 fresh	 from

thorough	 grooming	 at	 a	 Turkish	 bath,	 a	 new	 suit	 of	 dark	 clothes.	 But	 when	 he had	thrown	aside	his	soft	felt	hat,	his	face	showed	drawn,	pinched	and	haggard,

the	face	of	a	man	whose	sufferings	are	of	the	spirit	rather	than	of	the	body.	Loss of	sleep	might	have	accounted	in	part	for	that	expression,	but	not	for	all	of	it.

“What’s	the	matter?”	demanded	Staff,	deeply	concerned.

“You	 ask	 me	 that!”	 said	 Iff	 impatiently.	 He	 threw	 himself	 at	 length	 upon	 the divan.	“Haven’t	you	been	to	the	St.	Simon?	Don’t	you	 know	what	has	happened?

Well,	so	have	I,	and	so	do	I.”

“Well	...?”

Iff	raised	himself	on	his	elbow	to	stare	at	Staff	as	if	questioning	his	sanity.

“You	know	she’s	gone—that	she’s	in	 his	hands—and	you	have	the	face	to	stand there	and	say	‘ Wel-l?’	to	me!”	he	snapped.

“But—good	 Lord,	 man!—what	 is	 Miss	 Searle	 to	 you	 that	 you	 should	 get	 so excited	 about	 her	 disappearance,	 even	 assuming	 what	 we’re	 not	 sure	 of—that she	decamped	with	Ismay?”

“She’s	only	everything	to	me,”	said	Iff	quietly:	“she’s	my	daughter.”

Staff	slumped	suddenly	into	a	chair.

“You’re	serious	about	that?”	he	gasped.

“It’s	not	a	matter	I	care	to	joke	about,”	said	the	little	man	gloomily.

“But	why	didn’t	you	tell	a	fellow	...!”

“Why	 should	 I—until	 now?	 You	 mustn’t	 forget	 that	 you	 sat	 in	 this	 room	 not twenty-four	 hours	 ago	 and	 listened	 to	 me	 retail	 what	 I	 admit	 sounded	 like	 the damnedest	 farrago	 of	 lies	 that	 was	 ever	 invented	 since	 the	 world	 began;	 and because	you	were	a	good	fellow	and	a	gentleman,	you	stood	for	it—gave	me	the

benefit	of	the	doubt.	And	at	that	I	hadn’t	told	you	half.	Why?	Why,	because	I	felt I	had	put	sufficient	strain	upon	your	credulity	for	one	session	at	least.”

“Yes—I	know,”	Staff	agreed,	bewildered;	“but—but	Miss	Searle—your	daughter

—!”

“That’s	a	hard	one	for	you	to	swallow——what?	I	don’t	blame	you.	But	it’s	true.

And	 that’s	 why	 I’m	 all	 worked	 up—half	 crazed	 by	 my	 knowledge	 that	 that infamous	blackguard	has	managed	to	deceive	her	and	make	her	believe	he	is	me

—myself—her	father.”

“But	what	makes	you	think	that?”

“Oh,	I’ve	his	word	for	it.	Read!”

Iff	whipped	an	envelope	from	his	pocket	and	flipped	it	over	to	Staff.	“He	knew,

of	 course,	 where	 I	 get	 my	 letters	 when	 in	 town,	 and	 took	 a	 chance	 of	 that catching	me	there	and	poisoning	the	sunlight	for	me.”

Staff	 turned	 the	 envelope	 over	 in	 his	 hands,	 remarking	 the	 name,	 address, postmark	and	special	delivery	 stamp.	 “Mailed	 at	 Hartford,	 Connecticut,	 at	 nine this	morning,”	he	commented.

“Read	it,”	insisted	Iff	irritably.

Staff	 withdrew	 the	 enclosure:	 a	 single	 sheet	 of	 note-paper	 with	 a	 few	 words scrawled	on	one	side.

“‘I’ve	got	her,’”	he	read	aloud.	“‘She	thinks	I’m	you.	Is	this	sufficient	warning	to you	to	keep	out	of	this	game?	If	not—you	know	what	to	expect.’”

He	looked	from	the	note	back	to	Iff.	“What	does	he	mean	by	that?”

“How	can	I	tell?	It’s	a	threat,	and	that’s	enough	for	me;	he’s	capable	of	anything fiendish	 enough	 to	 amuse	 him.”	 He	 shook	 his	 clenched	 fists	 impotently	 above his	head.	“Oh,	if	ever	again	I	get	within	arm’s	length	of	the	hound	...!”

“Look	here,”	said	Staff;	“I’m	a	good	deal	in	the	dark	about	this	business.	You’ve

got	to	calm	yourself	and	help	me	out.	Now	you	say	Miss	Searle’s	your	daughter;

yet	you	were	on	the	ship	together	and	didn’t	recognise	one	another—at	least,	so

far	as	I	could	see.”

“You	 don’t	 see	 everything,”	 said	 Iff;	 “but	 at	 that,	 you’re	 right—she	 didn’t recognise	me.	She	hasn’t	for	years—seven	years,	to	be	exact.	It	was	seven	years

ago	that	she	ran	away	from	me	and	changed	her	name.	And	it	was	all	 his	doing!

I’ve	 told	 you	 that	 Ismay	 has,	 in	 his	 jocular	 way,	 made	 a	 practice	 of	 casting suspicion	on	me.	Well,	the	thing	got	so	bad	that	he	made	her	believe	I	was	the

criminal	in	the	family.	So,	being	the	right	sort	of	a	girl,	she	couldn’t	live	with	me

any	longer	and	she	just	naturally	shook	me—went	to	Paris	to	study	singing	and fit	herself	to	earn	a	living.	I	followed	her,	pleaded	with	her,	but	she	couldn’t	be made	to	understand;	so	I	had	to	give	it	up.	And	that	was	when	I	registered	my

oath	to	follow	this	cur	to	the	four	corners	of	the	earth,	if	need	be,	and	wait	my

chance	 to	 trip	 him	 up,	 expose	 him	 and	 clear	 myself.	 And	 now	 he’s	 finding	 the going	 a	 bit	 rough,	 thanks	 to	 my	 public-spirited	 endeavours,	 and	 he	 takes	 this means	of	tying	my	hands!”

“I	should	think,”	said	Staff,	“you’d	have	shot	him	long	before	this.”

“Precisely,”	 agreed	 Iff	 mockingly.	 “That’s	 just	 where	 the	 bone-headedness

comes	in	that	so	endears	you	to	your	friends.	If	I	killed	him,	where	would	be	my

chance	 to	 prove	 I	 hadn’t	 been	 guilty	 of	 the	 crimes	 he’s	 laid	 at	 my	 door?	 He’s realised	 that,	 all	 along....	 I	 passed	 him	 on	 deck	 one	 night,	 coming	 over;	 it	 was midnight	and	we	were	alone;	the	temptation	to	lay	hands	on	him	and	drop	him

overboard	 was	 almost	 irresistible—and	 he	 knew	 it	 and	 laughed	 in	 my	 face!...

And	that’s	the	true	reason	why	I	didn’t	accuse	him	when	I	was	charged	with	the

theft	 of	 the	 necklace—because	 I	 couldn’t	 prove	 anything	 and	 a	 trumped-up accusation	 that	 fell	 through	 would	 only	 make	 my	 case	 the	 worse	 in	 Nelly’s sight....	But	I’ll	get	him	yet!”

“Have	you	thought	of	going	to	Hartford?”

“I’m	 no	 such	 fool.	 If	 that	 letter	 was	 posted	 in	 Hartford	 this	 morning,	 it	 means that	Ismay’s	in	Philadelphia.”

“But	isn’t	he	wise	enough	to	know	you’d	think	just	that?”

Iff	sat	up	with	a	flush	of	excitement.	“By	George!”	he	cried—“there’s	something

in	that!”

“It’s	a	chance,”	said	Staff	thoughtfully.

The	little	man	jumped	up	and	began	to	pace	the	floor.	To	and	fro,	from	the	hall-

door	to	the	windows,	he	strode.	At	perhaps	the	seventh	turn	at	the	windows	he

paused,	looking	out,	then	moved	quickly	back	to	Staff’s	side.

“Taxicab	stopping	outside,”	 he	said	in	 a	low	voice:	 “woman	getting	out—Miss

Landis,	I	think.	If	you	don’t	mind,	I’ll	dodge	into	your	bedroom.”

“By	all	means,”	assented	his	host,	rising.

Iff	swung	out	of	sight	into	the	back	room	as	Staff	went	to	and	opened	the	hall-door.

Alison	had	just	gained	the	head	of	the	stairs.	She	came	to	the	study	door,	moving

with	her	indolent	grace,	acknowledging	his	greeting	with	an	insolent,	cool	nod.

“Not	too	late,	I	trust?”	she	said	enigmatically.

“For	what?”	asked	Staff,	puzzled.

“For	this	appointment,”	she	said,	extending	a	folded	bit	of	paper.

“Appointment?”	he	repeated	with	the	rising	inflection,	taking	the	paper.

“It	was	delivered	at	my	hotel	half	an	hour	ago,”	she	told	him.	“I	presumed	you

...”

“No,”	said	Staff.	“Half	a	minute....”

He	 shut	 the	 door	 and	 unfolded	 the	 note.	 The	 paper	 and	 the	 chirography,	 he noticed,	were	identical	with	those	of	the	note	received	by	Iff	from	Hartford.	With this	settled	to	his	satisfaction,	he	read	the	contents	aloud,	raising	his	voice	a	trifle for	the	benefit	of	the	listener	in	the	back	room.

“‘If	Miss	Landis	wishes	to	arrange	for	the	return	of	the	Cadogan	collar,	will

she	 be	 kind	 enough	 to	 call	 at	 Mr.	 Staff’s	 rooms	 in	 Thirtieth	 Street	 at	 a quarter	to	ten	tonight.

“‘N.	 B.—Any	 attempt	 to	 bring	 the	 police	 or	 private	 detectives	 or	 other

outsiders	into	the	negotiations	will	be	instantly	known	to	the	writer	and—

there	won’t	be	any	party.’”

“Unsigned,”	said	Staff	reflectively.

“Well?”	demanded	Alison,	seating	herself.

“Curious,”	remarked	Staff,	still	thinking.

“Well?”	she	iterated	less	patiently.	“Is	it	a	practical	joke?”

“No,”	he	said,	smiling;	“to	me	it	looks	like	business.”

“You	mean	that	the	thief	intends	to	come	here—to	bargain	with	me?”

“I	should	fancy	so,	from	what	he	says....	And,”	Staff	added,	crossing	to	his	desk,

“forewarned	is	forearmed.”

He	 bent	 over	 and	 pulled	 out	 the	 drawer	 containing	 his	 revolver.	 At	 the	 same moment	he	heard	Alison	catch	her	breath	sharply,	and	a	man’s	voice	replied	to

his	platitude.

“Not	always,”	it	said	crisply.	“Be	good	enough	to	leave	that	gun	lay—just	hold

up	your	hands,	where	I	can	see	them,	and	come	away	from	that	desk.”

Staff	 laughed	 shortly	 and	 swung	 smartly	 round,	 exposing	 empty	 hands.	 In	 the brief	 instant	 in	 which	 his	 back	 had	 been	 turned	 a	 man	 had	 let	 himself	 into	 the study	from	the	hall.	He	stood	now	with	his	back	to	the	door,	covering	Staff	with

an	automatic	pistol.

“Come	 away,”	 he	 said	 in	 a	 peremptory	 tone,	 emphasising	 his	 meaning	 with	 a flourish	of	the	weapon.	“Over	here—by	Miss	Landis,	if	you	please.”

Quietly	Staff	obeyed.	He	had	knocked	about	the	world	long	enough	to	recognise

the	tone	of	a	man	talking	business	with	a	gun.	He	placed	himself	beside	Alison’s

chair	and	waited,	wondering.

Indeed,	 he	 was	 very	 much	 perplexed	 and	 disturbed.	 For	 the	 first	 time	 since	 Iff had	 won	 his	 confidence	 against	 his	 better	 judgment,	 his	 faith	 in	 the	 little	 man was	being	shaken.	This	high-handed	intruder	was	so	close	a	counterpart	of	Mr.

Iff	 that	 one	 had	 to	 look	 twice	 to	 distinguish	 the	 difference,	 and	 then	 found	 the points	 of	 variance	 negligible—so	 much	 so	 that	 the	 fellow	 might	 well	 be	 Iff	 in different	clothing	and	another	manner.	And	Iff	could	easily	have	slipped	out	of

the	bedroom	by	 its	hall	door.	Only,	to	shift	his	clothes	so	quickly	he	would	have to	be	a	lightning-change	artist	of	exceptional	ability.

On	the	whole,	Staff	decided,	this	couldn’t	be	Iff.	And	yet	...	and	yet	...

“You	may	put	up	that	pistol,”	he	said	coolly.	“I’m	not	going	to	jump	you,	so	it’s

unnecessary.	 Besides,	 it’s	 bad	 form	 with	 a	 lady	 present.	 And	 finally,	 if	 you should	happen	to	let	it	off	the	racket	would	bring	the	police	down	on	you	more

quickly	than	you’d	like,	I	fancy.”

The	 man	 grinned	 and	 shoved	 the	 weapon	 into	 a	 pocket	 from	 which	 its	 grip projected	handily.

“Something	 in	 what	 you	 say,”	 he	 assented.	 “Besides,	 I’m	 quick,	 surprisingly

quick	with	my	hands.”

“Part	of	your	professional	equipment,	no	doubt,”	commented	Staff	indifferently.

“Admit	it,”	said	the	other	easily.	He	turned	his	attention	to	Alison.	“Well,	Miss

Landis	...?”

“Well,	Mr.	Iff?”	she	returned	in	the	same	tone.

“No,”	he	corrected;	“not	Iff—Ismay.”

“So	you’ve	changed	identities	again!”

“Surely	you	don’t	mind?”	he	said,	grinning	over	the	evasion.

“But	you	denied	being	Ismay	aboard	the	Autocratic.”

“My	 dear	 lady,	 you	 couldn’t	 reasonably	 expect	 me	 to	 plead	 guilty	 to	 a	 crime which	I	had	not	yet	committed.”

“Oh,	get	down	to	business!”	Staff	interrupted	impatiently.	“You’re	wasting	time

—yours	as	well	as	ours.”

“Peevish	person,	your	young	friend,”	Ismay	commented	confidentially	to	Alison.

“Still,	there’s	something	in	what	he	says.	Shall	we—ah—begin	to	negotiate?”

“I	think	you	may	as	well,”	she	agreed	coldly.

“Very	 well,	 then.	 The	 case	 is	 simple	 enough.	 I’m	 here	 to	 offer	 to	 secure	 the return	of	the	Cadogan	collar	for	an	appropriate	reward.”

“Ten	thousand	dollars	has	been	offered,”	she	began.

“Not	 half	 enough,	 my	 dear	 lady,”	 he	 interposed.	 “You	 insult	 the	 necklace	 by naming	such	a	meagre	sum—to	say	nothing	of	undervaluing	 my	intelligence.”

“So	that’s	it!”	she	said	reflectively.

“That	 is	 it,	 precisely.	 I	 am	 in	 communication	 with	 the	 person	 who	 stole	 your necklace;	she’s	willing	to	return	it	for	a	reward	of	reasonable	size.”

“She?	You	mean	Miss	Searle?”

The	man	made	a	deprecating	gesture.	“Please	don’t	ask	me	to	name	the	lady....”

“I	knew	it!”	Alison	cried	triumphantly.

“You	puppy!”	Staff	exclaimed.	“Haven’t	you	the	common	manhood	to	shoulder

the	responsibility	for	your	crimes	yourself?”

“Tush,”	 said	 the	 man	 gently—“tush!	 Not	 a	 pretty	 way	 to	 talk	 at	 all—calling names!	I’m	surprised.	Besides,	I	ought	to	know	better	than	you,	acting	as	I	do	as

agent	for	the	lady	in	question.”

“That’s	 a	 flat	 lie,”	 said	 Staff.	 “If	 you	 repeat	 it—I	 warn	 you—I’ll	 jump	 you	 as sure	’s	my	name’s	Staff,	pistol	or	no	pistol!”

“Aren’t	 you	 rather	 excited	 in	 your	 defence	 of	 this	 woman?”	 Alison	 turned	 on him	with	a	curling	lip.

“I’ve	a	right	to	my	emotions,”	he	retorted—“to	betray	them	as	I	see	fit.”

“And	I,”	Ismay	put	it,	“to	my	freedom	of	speech—”

“Not	 in	 my	 rooms,”	 Staff	 interrupted	 hotly.	 “I’ve	 warned	 you.	 Drop	 this nonsense	 about	 Miss	 Searle	 if	 you	 want	 to	 stop	 here	 another	 minute	 without	 a fight.	Drop	it!	Say	what	you	want	to	say	to	Miss	Landis——and	get	out!”

He	 was	 thoroughly	 enraged,	 and	 his	 manner	 of	 expressing	 himself	 seemed	 to convince	 the	 thief.	 With	 a	 slight	 shrug	 of	 his	 shoulders	 he	 again	 addressed himself	directly	to	Alison.

“In	the	matter	of	the	reward,”	he	said,	“we’re	of	the	opinion	that	you’ve	offered

too	little	by	half.	Twenty	thousand	at	the	least—”

“You	forget	I	have	the	duty	to	pay.”

“My	 dear	 lady,	 if	 you	 had	 not	 been	 anxious	 to	 evade	 payment	 of	 the	 duty	 you would	be	enjoying	the	ownership	of	your	necklace	today.”

As	he	spoke	the	telephone-bell	rang.	Staff	turned	away	to	his	desk,	Ismay’s	voice

pursuing	him	with	the	caution.

“Don’t	forget	about	that	open	drawer—keep	your	hands	away	from	it.”

“Oh,	be	quiet,”	returned	Staff	contemptuously.	 Standing	 with	 his	 back	 to	 them, he	took	up	the	instrument	and	lifted	off	the	receiver.

“Hello?”	he	said	irritably.

He	was	glad	that	his	face	was	not	visible	to	his	guests;	he	could	restrain	a	start	of surprise,	 but	 was	 afraid	 his	 expression	 would	 have	 betrayed	 him	 when	 he recognised	the	voice	at	the	other	end	of	the	line	as	Iff’s.

“Don’t	 repeat	 my	 name,”	 it	 said	 quickly	 in	 a	 tone	 low	 but	 clear.	 “That	 is	 Iff.

Ismay	still	there?”

“Yes,”	said	Staff	instantly:	“it’s	I,	Harry.	How	are	you?”

“Get	rid	of	him	as	quick	’s	you	can,”	Iff	continued,	“and	join	me	here	at	the	Park Avenue.	I	dodged	down	the	fire-escape	and	caught	his	motor-car;	his	chauffeur

thinks	I’m	him.	I’ll	wait	in	the	street—Thirty-third	Street	side,	with	the	car.	Now talk.”

“All	right,”	said	Staff	heartily;	“glad	to.	I’ll	be	there.”

“Chauffeur	 knows	 where	 Nelly	 is,	 I	 think;	 but	 he’s	 too	 big	 for	 me	 to	 handle alone,	in	case	my	foot	slips	and	he	gets	suspicious.	That’s	why	I	need	you.	Bring

your	gun.”

“Right,”	Staff	agreed	promptly.	“The	club	in	half	an	hour.	Yes,	I’ll	come.	Good-

bye.”

He	 turned	 back	 toward	 Ismay	 and	 Alison,	 his	 doubts	 resolved,	 all	 his	 vague misgivings	as	to	this	case	of	double	identity	settled	finally	and	forever.

“Alison,”	he	said,	breaking	in	roughly	upon	something	Ismay	was	saying	to	the

girl,	“you’ve	a	cab	waiting	outside,	haven’t	you?”

Alison	stared	in	surprise.	“Yes,”	she	said	in	a	tone	of	wonder.

Staff	paused	beside	the	divan,	one	hand	resting	upon	the	topmost	of	a	little	heap

of	silken	cushions.	“Mind	if	I	borrow	it?”	he	asked,	ignoring	the	man.

“No,	but—”

“It’s	 business—important,”	 said	 Staff.	 “I’ll	 have	 to	 leave	 you	 here	 at	 once.

Only”—he	watched	Ismay	closely	out	of	the	corners	of	his	eyes—“if	I	were	you

I	 wouldn’t	 waste	 any	 more	 time	 on	 this	 fellow.	 He’s	 bluffing—can’t	 carry	 out anything	he	promises.”

Ismay	turned	toward	him,	expostulant.

“What	d’	you	mean	by	that?”	he	demanded.

“Miss	Searle	has	escaped,”	said	Staff	deliberately.

“No!”	cried	Ismay,	startled	and	thrown	off	his	guard	by	the	fear	it	might	be	so.

“Impossible!”

“Think	so?”	As	he	spoke	Staff	dextrously	snatched	up	the	uppermost	pillow	and

with	a	twist	of	his	hand	sent	it	whirling	into	the	thief’s	face.

It	 took	 him	 utterly	 unawares.	 His	 arms	 flew	 up	 too	 late	 to	 ward	 it	 off,	 and	 he staggered	back	a	pace.

“Lots	 of	 impossible	 things	 keep	 happening	 all	 the	 time,”	 chuckled	 Staff	 as	 he closed	in.

There	was	hardly	a	struggle.	Staff’s	left	arm	clipped	the	man	about	the	waist	at

the	same	time	that	his	right	hand	deftly	abstracted	the	pistol	from	its	convenient pocket.	Then,	dropping	the	weapon	into	his	own	pocket,	he	transferred	his	hold

to	Ismay’s	collar	and	spun	him	round	with	a	snap	that	fairly	jarred	his	teeth.

“There,	confound	you!”	he	said,	exploring	his	pockets	for	other	lethal	weapons

and	finding	nothing	but	three	loaded	clips	ready	to	be	inserted	in	the	hollow	butt of	 the	 pistol	 already	 confiscated.	 “Now	 what	 ’m	 I	 going	 to	 do	 with	 you,	 you blame’	little	pest?”

The	question	was	more	to	himself	than	to	Ismay,	but	the	latter,	recovering	with

astonishing	quickness,	answered	Staff	by	suddenly	squirming	out	of	his	coat	and

leaving	it	in	his	assailant’s	hands	as	he	ducked	to	the	door	and	flung	himself	out.

Staff	 broke	 into	 a	 laugh	 as	 the	 patter	 of	 the	 little	 man’s	 feet	 was	 heard	 on	 the stairs.

“Resourceful	 beggar,”	 he	 commented,	 going	 to	 the	 window	 and	 rolling	 up	 the coat	as	he	went.	He	reached	it	just	in	time	to	see	the	thief	dodge	out.

The	 coat,	 opening	 as	 it	 descended,	 fell	 like	 a	 blanket	 round	 Ismay’s	 head.	 He stumbled,	tripped	and	fell	headlong	down	the	steps,	sprawling	and	cursing.

“Thought	you	might	need	it,”	Staff	apologised	as	the	man	picked	himself	up	and

darted	away.

He	turned	to	confront	an	infuriated	edition	of	Alison.

“Why	did	you	do	that?”	she	demanded	with	a	stamp	of	her	foot.	“What	right	had

you	to	interfere?	I	was	beating	him	down;	in	another	minute	we’d	have	come	to terms—”

“Oh,	 don’t	 be	 silly,	 my	 dear,”	 said	 Staff,	 taking	 his	 revolver	 from	 the	 desk-drawer	and	placing	it	in	the	hip-pocket	of	tradition.	“To	begin	with,	I	don’t	mind telling	 you	 I	 don’t	 give	 much	 of	 a	 whoop	 whether	 you	 ever	 get	 that	 necklace back	or	not.”	He	grabbed	his	hat	and	started	for	the	door.	“What	I’m	interested	in is	the	rescue	of	Miss	Searle,	if	you	must	know;	and	that’s	going	to	happen	before

long,	or	I	miss	my	guess.”	He	paused	at	the	open	door.	“If	we	get	her,	we	get	the

necklace,	of	course—and	the	Lord	knows	you’ll	be	welcome	to	that.	Would	you

mind	turning	out	the	lights	before	you	go?”

“Staff!”

Her	tone	was	so	peremptory	that	he	hesitated	an	unwelcome	moment	longer.

“Well?”	he	asked	civilly,	wondering	what	on	earth	she	had	found	to	fly	into	such

a	beastly	rage	about.

“You	know	what	this	means?”

“You	tell	me,”	he	smiled.

“It	means	the	break;	I	won’t	play	 A	Single	Woman!”	she	snapped.

“That’s	the	best	guess	you’ve	made	yet,”	he	laughed.	“You	win.	Good	night	and

—good-bye.”





XVI

NINETY	MINUTES

Commandeering	Alison’s	taxicab	with	the	promise	of	an	extra	tip,	Staff	jumped

in	and	shut	the	door.	As	they	swung	into	Fourth	Avenue,	he	caught	a	glimpse	of

Ismay’s	 slight	 figure	 standing	 on	 the	 corner,	 his	 pose	 expressive	 of	 indecision and	uncertainty;	and	Staff	smiled	to	himself,	surmising	that	it	was	there	that	the thief	had	left	his	motor-car	to	be	confiscated	by	Iff.

Three	 blocks	 north	 on	 Fourth	 Avenue,	 and	 they	 swung	 west	 into	 Thirty-third Street:	 a	 short	 course	 quickly	 covered,	 but	 yet	 not	 swiftly	 enough	 to	 outpace Staff’s	impatience.	He	had	the	door	open,	his	foot	on	the	step,	before	the	taxicab had	 begun	 to	 slow	 down	 preparatory	 to	 stopping	 beside	 the	 car	 waiting	 in	 the shadow	of	the	big	hotel.

Iff	 was	 in	 the	 tonneau,	 gesticulating	 impatiently;	 the	 chauffeur	 had	 already cranked	 up	 and	 was	 sliding	 into	 his	 seat.	 As	 the	 taxicab	 rolled	 alongside,	 Staff jumped,	thrust	double	the	amount	registered	by	the	meter	into	the	driver’s	hand,

and	sprang	into	the	body	of	Ismay’s	car.	Iff	snapped	the	door	shut;	as	though	set

in	 motion	 by	 that	 sharp	 sound,	 the	 machine	 began	 to	 move	 smoothly	 and

smartly,	 gathering	 momentum	 with	 every	 revolution	 of	 its	 wheels.	 They	 were crossing	 Madison	 almost	 before	 Staff	 had	 settled	 into	 his	 seat.	 A	 moment	 later they	were	snoring	up	Fifth	Avenue.

Staff	looked	at	his	watch.	“Ten,”	he	told	Iff.

“We’ll	make	time	once	we	get	clear	of	this	island,”	said	the	little	man	anxiously;

“we’ve	got	to.”

“Why?”

“To	beat	Ismay—”

Staff	checked	him	with	a	hand	on	his	arm	and	a	warning	glance	at	the	back	of

the	chauffeur’s	head.

“Oh,	 that’s	 all	 right	 now,”	 Iff	 told	 him	 placidly.	 “I	 thought	 we	 might	 ’s	 well understand	one	another	first	as	last;	so,	while	we	were	waiting	for	you,	I	slipped

him	fifty,	gave	him	to	understand	that	my	affectionate	cousin	had	about	come	to the	 end	 of	 his	 rope	 and—won	 his	 heart	 and	 confidence.	 It’s	 a	 way	 I	 have	 with people;	 they	 do	 seem	 to	 fall	 for	 me,”	 he	 asserted	 with	 insufferable	 self-complacence.

He	 continued	 to	 impart	 his	 purchased	 information	 to	 Staff	 by	 snatches	 all	 the way	from	Thirty-fourth	Street	to	the	Harlem	River.

“He’s	a	decent	sort,”	he	said,	indicating	the	operator	with	a	nod;	“apparently,	that is;	name,	Spelvin.	Employed	by	a	garage	upon	the	West	Side,	in	the	Seventies.

Says	 Ismay	 rang	 ’em	 up	 about	 half-past	 two	 last	 night,	 chartered	 this	 car	 and driver,	to	be	kept	waiting	for	him	whenever	he	called	for	it....	Coarse	work	that, for	Cousin	Arbuthnot—very,	very	crude....

“Still,	 he’d	 just	 got	 home	 and	 hadn’t	 had	 time	 to	 make	 very	 polished

arrangements....	Seems	he	told	this	chap	he	was	to	see	nothing	but	the	road,	hear

nothing	 but	 the	 motor,	 say	 nothing	 whatever	 to	 nobody.	 Gave	 him	 a	 fifty,	 too.

That	habit	seems	to	run	in	the	family....

“He	called	for	the	car	around	five	o’clock,	with	Nelly.	Spelvin	says	she	seemed

worn	out,	hardly	conscious	of	what	was	going	on.	They	lit	out	for—where	we’re

bound:	 place	 on	 the	 Connecticut	 shore	 called	 Pennymint	 Point.	 On	 the	 way Ismay	told	him	to	stop	at	a	roadhouse,	got	out	and	brought	Nelly	a	drink.	Spelvin

says	 he	 wouldn’t	 be	 surprised	 if	 it	 was	 doped;	 she	 slept	 all	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 way and	hardly	woke	up	even	when	they	helped	her	aboard	the	boat.”

“Boat!”

“Motor-boat.	 I	 infer	 that	 Cousin	 Arbuthnot	 has	 established	 headquarters	 on	 a little	two-by-four	island	in	the	 Sound—Wreck	Island.	Used	 to	be	run	 as	a	one-horse	 summer	 resort—hotel	 and	 all	 that.	 Went	 under	 several	 years	 ago,	 if mem’ry	 serveth	 me	 aright.	 Anyhow,	 they	 loaded	 Nelly	 aboard	 this	 motor-boat and	took	her	across....

“Spelvin	was	told	to	wait.	He	did.	In	about	an	hour—boat	back;	native	running	it

hands	Spelvin	a	note,	tells	him	to	run	up	to	Hartford	and	post	it	and	be	back	at

seven	 P.M.	 Spelvin	 back	 at	 seven;	 Ismay	 comes	 across	 by	 boat,	 is	 driven	 to town....

“That’s	all,	to	date.	Spelvin	had	begun	to	suspect	there	was	something	crooked

going	 on,	 which	 made	 him	 easy	 meat	 for	 my	 insidious	 advances.	 Says	 he	 was

wondering	if	he	hadn’t	better	tell	his	troubles	to	a	cop.	All	of	which	goes	to	show that	 Cousin	 Artie’s	 fast	 going	 to	 seed.	 Very	 crude	 operating—man	 of	 his reputation,	too.	Makes	me	almost	ashamed	of	the	relationship.”

“How	are	we	going	to	get	to	Wreck	Island	from	Pennymint	Point?”

“Same	boat,”	said	Iff	confidently.	“Spelvin	heard	Ismay	tell	his	engineer	to	wait

for	him—would	be	back	between	midnight	and	three.”

“He	can’t	beat	us	there,	can	he,	by	any	chance?”

“He	 can	 if	 he	 humps	 himself.	 This	 is	 a	 pretty	 good	 car,	 and	 Spelvin	 says	 there isn’t	going	to	be	any	car	on	the	road	tonight	that’ll	pass	us;	but	I	can’t	forget	that dear	old	New	York,	New	Haven	&	Hartford.	They	run	some	fast	trains	by	night,

and	 while	 of	 course	 none	 of	 them	 stops	 at	 Pennymint	 Centre—station	 for	 the Point—still,	a	man	with	plenty	of	money	to	fling	around	can	get	a	whole	lot	of

courtesy	out	of	a	railroad.”

“Then	 the	 question	 is:	 can	 he	 catch	 a	 train	 which	 passes	 through	 Pennymint Centre	before	we	can	reasonably	expect	to	get	there?”

“That’s	the	intelligent	query.	I	don’t	know.	Do	you?”

“No—”

“Spelvin	 doesn’t,	 and	 we	 haven’t	 got	 any	 time	 to	 waste	 trying	 to	 find	 out.

Probabilities	are,	there	is.	The	only	thing	to	do	is	to	run	for	it	and	trust	to	luck.

Spelvin	says	it	took	him	an	hour	and	thirty-five	minutes	to	run	in,	this	evening;

and	 he’s	 going	 to	 better	 that	 if	 nothing	 happens.	 Did	 you	 remember	 to	 bring	 a gun?”

“Two.”	Staff	produced	the	pistol	he	had	taken	from	Ismay,	with	the	extra	clips,

and	gave	them	to	the	little	man	with	an	account	of	how	he	had	become	possessed

of	them—a	narrative	which	Iff	seemed	to	enjoy	immensely.

“Oh,	 we	 can’t	 lose,”	 he	 chuckled;	 “not	 when	 Cousin	 Artie	 plays	 his	 hand	 as poorly	as	he	has	this	deal.	I’ve	got	a	perfectly	sound	hunch	that	we’ll	win.”

Staff	hardly	shared	his	confidence;	still,	as	far	as	he	could	judge,	the	odds	were even.	Ismay	might	beat	them	to	Pennymint	Centre	by	train,	and	might	not.	If	he

did,	however,	it	could	not	be	by	more	than	a	slight	margin;	to	balance	which	fact, Staff	 had	 to	 remind	 himself	 that	 two	 minutes’	 margin	 was	 all	 that	 would	 be

required	to	get	the	boat	away	from	land,	beyond	their	reach.

“Look	here,”	he	put	it	to	Iff:	“suppose	he	does	beat	us	to	that	boat?”

“Then	we’ll	have	to	find	another.”

“There’ll	be	another	handy,	all	ready	for	us,	I	presume?”

“Spare	me	your	sarcasm,”	pleaded	Iff;	“it	is,	if	you	don’t	mind	my	mentioning

the	fact,	not	your	forte.	Silence,	on	the	other	hand,	suits	your	style	cunningly.	So shut	up	and	lemme	think.”

He	relapsed	into	profound	meditations,	while	the	car	hummed	onwards	through

the	moon-drenched	spaces	of	the	night.

Presently	 he	 roused	 and,	 without	 warning,	 clambered	 over	 the	 back	 of	 the	 seat into	the	place	beside	the	chauffeur.	For	a	time	the	two	conferred,	heads	together, their	words	indistinguishable	in	the	sweep	of	air.	Then,	in	the	same	spry	fashion, the	little	man	returned.

“Spelvin’s	a	treasure,”	he	announced,	settling	into	his	place.

“Why?”

“Knows	the	country—knows	a	man	in	Barmouth	who	runs	a	shipyard,	owns	and

hires	out	motorboats,	and	all	that	sort	of	thing.”

“Where’s	Barmouth?”

“Four	miles	this	side	of	Pennymint	Point.	Now	we’ve	got	to	decide	whether	to

hold	on	and	run	our	chances	of	picking	up	Ismay’s	boat,	or	turn	off	to	Barmouth

and	run	our	chances	of	finding	chauffeur’s	friend	with	boat	disengaged.	What	do

you	think?”

“Barmouth,”	Staff	decided	after	some	deliberation	but	not	without	misgivings.

“That’s	what	I	told	Spelvin,”	observed	Iff.	“It’s	a	gamble	either	way.”

The	 city	 was	 now	 well	 behind	 them,	 the	 car	 pounding	 steadily	 on	 through Westchester.	For	a	long	time	neither	spoke.	The	time	for	talk,	indeed,	was	past—

and	in	the	future;	for	the	present	they	must	tune	themselves	up	to	action—such

action	as	the	furious	onrush	of	the	powerful	car	in	some	measure	typified,	easing

the	impatience	in	their	hearts.

For	 a	 time	 the	 road	 held	 them	 near	 railroad	 tracks.	 A	 train	 hurtled	 past	 them, running	eastwards:	a	roaring	streak	of	orange	light	crashing	through	the	world	of

cool	night	blues	and	purple-blacks.

The	chauffeur	swore	audibly	and	let	out	another	notch	of	speed.

Staff	sat	spellbound	by	the	amazing	romance	of	it	all....	A	bare	eight	days	since

that	afternoon	when	a	whim,	born	of	a	love	now	lifeless,	had	stirred	him	out	of

his	solitary,	work-a-day	life	in	London,	had	lifted	him	out	of	the	ordered	security of	the	centre	of	the	world’s	civilisation	and	sent	him	whirling	dizzily	across	three thousand	 miles	 and	 more	 to	 become	 a	 partner	 in	 this	 wild,	 weird	 ride	 to	 the rescue	of	a	damsel	in	distress	and	durance	vile!	Incredible!...

Eight	days:	and	the	sun	of	Alison,	that	once	he	had	thought	to	be	the	light	of	all the	 world,	 had	 set;	 while	 in	 the	 evening	 sky	 the	 star	 of	 Eleanor	 was	 rising	 and blazing	ever	more	brightly....

Now	 when	 a	 man	 begins	 to	 think	 about	 himself	 and	 his	 heart	 in	 such	 poetic imagery,	the	need	for	human	intercourse	grows	imperative	on	his	understanding;

he	must	talk	or—suffer	severely.

Staff	turned	upon	his	defenseless	companion.

“Iff,”	said	he,	“when	a	man’s	the	sort	of	a	man	who	can	fall	out	of	love	and	in

again—with	another	woman,	of	course—inside	a	week—what	do	you	call	him?”

“Human,”	announced	Iff	after	mature	consideration	of	the	problem.

This	was	unsatisfactory;	Staff	yearned	to	be	called	fickle.

“Human?	How’s	that?”	he	insisted.

“I	 mean	 that	 the	 human	 man	 hasn’t	 got	 much	 to	 say	 about	 falling	 in	 or	 out	 of love.	The	women	take	care	of	all	that	for	him.	Look	at	your	Miss	Landis—yours

as	was....	You	don’t	mind	my	buttin’	in?”

“Go	on,”	said	Staff	grimly.

“Anybody	with	half	an	eye,	always	excepting	you,	could	see	she’d	made	up	her

mind	 to	 hook	 that	 Arkroyd	 pinhead	 on	 account	 of	 his	 money.	 She	 was	 just waiting	 for	 a	 fair	 chance	 to	 give	 you	 the	 office—preferably,	 of	 course,	 after she’d	nailed	that	play	of	yours.”

“Well,”	said	Staff,	“she’s	lost	that,	too.”

“Serves	you	both	right.”

There	 was	 a	 pause	 wherein	 Staff	 sought	 to	 fathom	 the	 meaning	 of	 this	 last utterance	of	Mr.	Iff’s.

“I	take	it,”	resumed	the	latter	with	a	sidelong	look—“pardon	a	father’s	feelings

of	delicacy—I	take	it,	you’re	meaning	Nelly?”

“How	did	you	guess	that?”	demanded	Staff,	startled.

“Right,	eh?”

“Yes—no—I	don’t	know—”

“Well,	 if	 you	 don’t	 know	 the	 answer	 any	 better	 ’n	 that,	 take	 a	 word	 of	 advice from	an	old	bird:	you	get	her	to	tell	you.	She’s	known	it	ever	since	she	laid	eyes on	you.”

“You	mean	she—I—”	Staff	stammered	eagerly.

“I	 mean	 nobody	 knows	 anything	 about	 a	 woman’s	 heart	 but	 herself;	 but	 she knows	it	backwards	and	all	the	time.”

“Then	you	don’t	think	I’ve	got	any	show?”

“Oh,	Lord!”	complained	Iff.	“Honest,	you	gimme	a	pain.	Go	on	and	do	your	own

thinking.”

Staff	 subsided,	 imagining	 a	 vain	 thing:	 that	 the	 mantle	 of	 dignity	 in	 which	 he wrapped	 himself	 successfully	 cloaked	 his	 sense	 of	 injury.	 Iff	 smiled	 a

meaningless	 smile	 up	 at	 the	 inscrutable	 skies.	 And	 the	 moonlit	 miles	 slipped beneath	the	wheels	like	a	torrent	of	moulten	silver.

At	 length—it	 seemed	 as	 if	 many	 hours	 must	 have	 swung	 crashing	 into	 eternity since	they	had	left	New	York—Staff	was	conscious	of	a	perceptible	diminution

of	speed;	he	was	able	to	get	his	breath	with	less	effort,	had	no	longer	to	snatch	it by	 main	 strength	 from	 the	 greedy	 clutches	 of	 the	 whirlwind.	 The	 reeling chiaroscuro	of	the	countryside	seemed	suddenly	to	become	calm,	settling	into	an

intelligible,	 more	 or	 less	 orderly	 arrangement	 of	 shining	 hills	 and	 shadowed hollows,	 spreading	 pastures	 and	 sombre	 woodlands.	 The	 chauffeur	 flung	 a	 few inarticulate	 words	 over	 his	 shoulder—readily	 interpreted	 as	 announcing	 the

nearness	 of	 their	 destination;	 and	 of	 a	 sudden	 the	 car	 swung	 from	 the	 main highway	into	a	narrow	by-road	that	ran	off	to	the	right.	A	little	later	they	darted through	a	cut	beneath	railroad	tracks,	and	a	village	sprang	out	of	the	night	and

rattled	past	them,	serenely	slumbrous.	From	this	centre	a	thin	trickle	of	dwellings straggled	 along	 their	 way.	 Across	 fields	 to	 the	 left,	 Staff	 caught	 glimpses	 of	 a spreading	sheet	of	water,	still	and	silvery-grey....

On	a	long	slant,	the	road	drew	nearer	and	more	near	to	the	shores	of	this	arm	of

the	Sound.	Presently	a	group	of	small	buildings	near	the	head	of	a	long	landing-

stage	swam	into	view.	Before	them	the	car	drew	up	with	a	sigh.	The	chauffeur

jumped	down	and	ran	across	the	road	to	a	house	in	whose	lower	story	a	lighted

window	 was	 visible.	 While	 he	 hammered	 at	 the	 door,	 Staff	 and	 Iff	 alighted.	 A man	in	his	shirt-sleeves	came	to	the	door	of	the	cottage	and	stood	there,	pipe	in

mouth,	hands	in	pockets,	languidly	interjecting	dispassionate	responses	into	the

chauffeur’s	animated	exposition	of	their	case.	As	Staff	and	Iff	came	up,	Spelvin

turned	to	them,	excitedly	waving	his	gauntlets.

“He’s	got	a	boat,	all	right,	and	a	good	one	he	says,	but	he	won’t	move	a	foot	for

less	’n	twenty	dollars.”

“Give	 you	 twenty-five	 if	 you	 get	 away	 from	 the	 dock	 within	 five	 minutes,”	 Iff told	the	boatbuilder	directly.

The	 man	 started	 as	 if	 stung.	 “Jemima!”	 he	 breathed,	 incredulous.	 Then	 caution prompted	him	to	 extend	a	calloused	 and	work-warped	hand.	 “Cross	my	palm,”

he	said.

“You	give	it	to	him,	Staff,”	said	Iff	magnificently.	“I’m	short	of	cash.”

Obediently,	Staff	disbursed	the	required	sum.	The	native	thumbed	it,	pocketed	it,

lifted	his	coat	from	a	nail	behind	the	door	and	started	across	the	road	in	a	single movement.

“You	 come	 ’long,	 Spelvin,”	 he	 said	 in	 passing,	 “’nd	 help	 with	 the	 boat.	 If	 you gents’ll	get	out	on	the	dock	I’ll	have	her	alongside	in	three	minutes,	’r	my	name

ain’t	Bascom.”

Pursued	 by	 the	 chauffeur,	 he	 disappeared	 into	 the	 huddle	 of	 boat-houses	 and beached	 and	 careened	 boats.	 A	 moment	 later,	 Iff	 and	 Staff,	 picking	 their	 way through	 the	 tangle,	 heard	 the	 scrape	 of	 a	 flat-bottomed	 boat	 on	 the	 beach	 and, subsequently,	splashing	oars.

By	 the	 time	 they	 had	 reached	 the	 end	 of	 the	 dock,	 the	 boatbuilder	 and	 his companion	 were	 scrambling	 aboard	 a	 twenty-five-foot	 boat	 at	 anchor	 in	 the midst	of	a	small	fleet	of	sail	and	gasoline	craft.	The	rumble	of	a	motor	followed

almost	instantly,	was	silenced	momentarily	while	the	skiff	was	being	made	fast

to	 the	 mooring,	 broke	 out	 again	 as	 the	 larger	 boat	 selected	 a	 serpentine	 path through	the	circumjacent	vessels	and	slipped	up	to	the	dock.

Before	it	had	lost	way,	Iff	and	Staff	were	aboard.	Instantly,	Bascom	snapped	the

switch	shut	and	the	motor	started	again	on	the	spark.

“Straight	 out,”	 he	 instructed	 Spelvin	 at	 the	 wheel,	 “till	 you	 round	 that	 white moorin’-dolphin.	Then	I’ll	take	her.”	...

Not	 long	 afterward	 he	 gave	 up	 pottering	 round	 the	 engine	 and	 went	 forward, relieving	Spelvin.	“You	go	back	and	keep	your	eye	on	that	engyne,”	he	ordered;

“she’s	workin’	like	a	sewin’-machine,	but	she	wants	watchin’.	I’ll	tell	you	when

to	 give	 her	 the	 spark.	 Meanwhile	 you	 might	 ’s	 well	 dig	 them	 lights	 out	 of	 the port	locker	and	set	’em	out.”

“No,”	Iff	put	in.	“We	want	no	lights.”

“Gov’mint	regulations,”	said	Bascom	stubbornly.	“Must	carry	lights.”

“Five	dollars?”	Iff	argued	persuasively.

“Agin	the	law,”	growled	Bascom.	“But—I	dunno—they	ain’t	anybody	likely	to

be	out	this	time	o’	night.	Cross	my	palm.”

And	Staff	again	disbursed.

The	 white	 mooring-buoy	 swam	 past	 and	 the	 little	 vessel	 heeled	 as	 Bascom swung	her	sharply	to	the	southwards.

“Now,”	he	told	Spelvin,	“advance	that	spark	all	you’ve	a	mind	to.”

There	was	a	click	from	the	engine-pit	and	the	steady	rumble	of	the	exhaust	ran

suddenly	into	a	prolonged	whining	drone.	The	boat	jumped	as	if	jerked	forward

by	some	gigantic,	invisible	hand.	Beneath	the	bows	the	water	parted	with	a	crisp

sound	like	tearing	paper.	Long	ripples	widened	away	from	the	sides,	like	ribs	of

a	 huge	 fan.	 A	 glassy	 hillock	 of	 water	 sprang	 up	 mysteriously	 astern,	 pursuing them	like	an	avenging	Nemesis,	yet	never	quite	catching	up.

The	sense	of	irresistible	speed	was	tremendous,	as	stimulating	as	electricity;	this

in	spite	of	the	fact	that	the	boat	was	at	best	making	about	half	the	speed	at	which the	motor-car	had	plunged	along	the	country	roads:	an	effect	in	part	due	to	the

spacious	illusion	of	moonlit	distances	upon	the	water.

Staff	held	his	cap	with	one	hand,	drinking	in	the	keen	salt	air	with	a	feeling	of

strange	 exultation.	 Iff	 crept	 forward	 and	 tarried	 for	 a	 time	 talking	 to	 the boatbuilder.

The	boat	shaved	a	nun-buoy	outside	Barmouth	Point	so	closely	that	Staff	could

almost	have	touched	it	by	stretching	out	his	arm.	Then	she	straightened	out	like	a greyhound	 on	 a	 long	 course	 across	 the	 placid	 silver	 reaches	 to	 a	 goal	 as	 yet invisible.

Iff	returned	to	the	younger	man’s	side.

“Twenty	miles	an	hour,	Bascom	claims,”	he	shouted.	“At	that	rate	we	ought	to

be	there	in	about	fifteen	minutes	now.”

Staff	 nodded,	 wondering	 what	 they	 would	 find	 on	 Wreck	 Island,	 bitterly

repenting	the	oversight	which	had	resulted	in	Ismay’s	escape	from	his	grasp.	If

only	 he	 had	 not	 been	 so	 sure	 of	 his	 conquest	 of	 the	 little	 criminal	 ...!	 Now	 his mind	crawled	with	 apprehensions	bred	of	 his	knowledge	of	 the	man’s	amazing

fund	of	resource.	He	who	outwitted	Ismay	would	have	earned	the	right	to	plume

himself	upon	his	cunning....

When	 he	 looked	 up	 from	 his	 abstraction,	 the	 loom	 of	 the	 mainland	 was

seemingly	 very	 distant.	 The	 motor-boat	 was	 nearing	 the	 centre	 of	 a	 deep indentation	 in	 the	 littoral.	 And	 suddenly	 it	 was	 as	 though	 they	 did	 not	 move	 at all,	as	if	all	this	noise	and	labour	went	for	nothing,	as	if	the	boat	were	chained	to the	 centre	 of	 a	 spreading	 disk	 of	 silver,	 world-wide,	 illimitable,	 and	 made	 no progress	for	all	its	thrashing	and	its	fury.

Only	the	unending	sweep	of	wind	across	his	face	denied	that	effect....

Iff	touched	his	arm.

“There....”	he	said,	pointing.

Over	the	bows	a	dark	mass	seemed	to	have	separated	itself	from	the	shadowed

mainland,	with	which	it	had	till	then	been	merged.	A	strip	of	silver	lay	between

the	two,	and	while	they	watched	it	widened,	swiftly	winning	breadth	and	bulk	as

the	motor-boat	swung	to	the	north	of	the	long,	sandy	spit	at	the	western	end	of

Wreck	Island.

“See	 anything	 of	 another	 boat?”	 Iff	 asked.	 “You	 look—your	 eyes	 are	 younger than	mine.”

Staff	 stood	 up,	 steadying	 himself	 with	 feet	 wide	 apart,	 and	 stared	 beneath	 his hand.

“No,”	he	said;	“I	see	no	boat.”

“We’ve	beaten	him,	then!”	Iff	declared	joyfully.

But	 they	 hadn’t,	 nor	 were	 they	 long	 in	 finding	 it	 out.	 For	 presently	 the	 little island	lay	black,	a	ragged	shadow	against	the	blue-grey	sky,	upon	the	starboard

beam;	and	Bascom	passed	the	word	aft	to	shut	off	the	motor.	As	its	voice	ceased,

the	 boat	 shot	 in	 toward	 the	 land,	 and	 the	 long	 thin	 moonlit	 line	 of	 the	 landing-stage	detached	itself	from	the	general	obscurity	and	ran	out	to	meet	them.	And

so	closely	had	Bascom	calculated	that	the	“shoot”	of	the	boat	brought	them	to	a

standstill	at	the	end	of	the	structure	without	a	jar.	Bascom	jumped	out	with	the

headwarp,	Staff	and	Iff	at	his	heels.

From	the	other	side	of	the	dock	a	shadow	uplifted	itself,	swiftly	and	silently	as	a wraith,	and	stood	swaying	as	it	saluted	them	with	profound	courtesy.

“Gennelmen,”	it	said	thickly,	“I	bidsh	you	welcome	t’	Wrecksh	Island.”

With	this	it	slumped	incontinently	back	into	a	motor-boat	which	lay	moored	in

the	shadow	of	the	dock;	and	a	wild,	ecstatic	snore	rang	out	upon	the	calm	night

air.

“Thet’s	 Eph	 Clover,”	 said	 Bascom;	 “him	 ’nd	 his	 wife’s	 caretakers	 here.	 He’s drunker	’n	a	b’iled	owl,”	added	the	boatbuilder	lest	they	misconstrue.

“Cousin	 Artie	 seems	 unfortunate	 in	 his	 choice	 of	 minions,	 what?”	 commented Iff.	“Come	along,	Staff....	Take	care	of	that	souse,	will	you,	Spelvin?	See	that	he doesn’t	try	to	mix	in.”

They	began	to	run	along	the	narrow,	yielding	and	swaying	bridge	of	planks.

“He	hasn’t	beaten	us	out	yet,”	Iff	threw	over	his	shoulder.	“You	keep	back	now

—like	a	good	child—please.	I’ve	got	a	hunch	this	is	my	hour.”

The	hotel	loomed	before	them,	gables	grey	with	moonshine,	its	long	walls	dark

save	 where,	 toward	 the	 middle	 of	 the	 main	 structure,	 chinks	 of	 light	 filtered through	a	shuttered	window,	and	where	at	one	end	an	open	door	let	out	a	shaft	of

lamplight	upon	the	shadows....





XVII

HOLOCAUST

For	a	period	of	perhaps	twenty	seconds	the	man	and	the	girl	remained	moveless,

eyeing	 one	 another;	 she	 on	 the	 floor,	 pale,	 stunned	 and	 pitiful,	 for	 the	 instant bereft	of	every	sense	save	that	of	terror;	he	in	the	doorway,	alert,	fully	the	master of	his	concentrated	faculties,	swayed	by	two	emotions	only—a	malignant	temper

bred	 of	 the	 night’s	 succession	 of	 reverses	 capped	 by	 the	 drunkenness	 of	 his caretaker,	and	an	equally	malignant	sense	of	triumph	that	he	had	returned	in	time

to	crush	the	girl’s	attempt	to	escape.

He	 threw	 the	 door	 wide	 open	 and	 took	 a	 step	 into	 the	 room,	 putting	 away	 his pistol.

“So—”	he	began	in	a	cutting	voice.

But	 his	 movement	 had	 acted	 as	 the	 shock	 needed	 to	 rouse	 the	 girl	 out	 of	 her stupor	 of	 despair.	 With	 a	 cry	 she	 gathered	 herself	 together	 and	 jumped	 to	 her feet.	He	put	forth	a	hand	as	if	to	catch	her,	and	she	leaped	back.	Her	skirts	swept the	lamp	on	the	floor	and	overturned	it	with	a	splintering	crash.	Instinctively	she sprang	away—in	the	nick	of	time.

She	 caught	 a	 look	 of	 surprise	 and	 fright	 in	 the	 eyes	 of	 the	 man	 as	 they	 glared past	 her	 in	 the	 ghastly	 glow	 of	 the	 flickering	 wick,	 and	 took	 advantage	 of	 this momentary	 distraction	 to	 leap	 past	 him.	 As	 she	 did	 so	 there	 was	 a	 slight explosion.	 A	 sheet	 of	 flaming	 kerosene	 spread	 over	 the	 floor	 and	 licked	 the chairboarding.

Ismay	 jumped	 back,	 mouthing	 curses;	 the	 girl	 had	 already	 slipped	 out	 of	 the room.	Turning,	he	saw	her	flying	through	the	hall	toward	the	main	door.	In	a	fit

of	futile,	childish	spite,	unreasonable	and	unreasoning,	he	whipped	out	his	pistol and	sent	a	bullet	after	her.

She	heard	it	whine	near	her	head	and	crash	through	the	glass	panes	of	the	door.

And	she	heard	herself	cry	out	in	a	strange	voice.	The	next	instant	she	had	flung

open	 the	 door	 and	 thrown	 herself	 out,	 across	 the	 veranda	 and	 down	 the	 steps.

Then	turning	blindly	to	the	left,	instinct	guiding	her	to	seek	temporary	safety	by hiding	in	the	wilderness	of	the	dunes,	she	blundered	into	somebody’s	arms.

She	 was	 caught	 and	 held	 fast	 despite	 her	 struggles	 to	 free	 herself:	 to	 which, believing	herself	to	be	in	the	hands	of	Mrs.	Clover	or	her	husband,	she	gave	all

her	strength.

At	 the	 same	 time	 the	 first-floor	 windows	 of	 the	 hotel	 were	 illumined	 by	 an infernal	 glare.	 All	 round	 her	 there	 was	 lurid	 light,	 setting	 everything	 in	 sharp relief.	The	face	of	the	man	who	held	her	was	suddenly	revealed;	and	it	was	her

father’s....	She	had	left	him	inside	the	building	and	now	...	She	was	assailed	with a	 terrifying	 fear	 that	 she	 had	 gone	 mad.	 In	 a	 frenzy	 she	 wrenched	 herself	 free; but	only	to	be	caught	in	other	arms.

A	voice	she	knew	said	soothingly:	“There,	Miss	Searle—you’re	all	right	now....”

Staff’s	voice	and,	when	she	twisted	to	look,	Staff’s	face,	friendly	and	reassuring!

“Don’t	be	afraid,”	he	was	saying;	“we’ll	take	care	of	you	now—your	father	and

I.”

“My	father!”	she	gasped.	“My	father	is	in	there!”

“No,”	 said	 Iff	 at	 her	 side.	 “Believe	 me,	 he	 isn’t.	 That,	 dear,	 is	 your	 fondly affectionate	 Uncle	 Arbuthnot—and	 between	 the	 several	 of	 us	 I	 don’t	 mind

telling	you	that	he’s	stood	in	my	shoes	for	the	last	time.”

“But	I	don’t,”	she	stammered—“I	don’t	understand—”

“You	will	in	a	minute,”	Staff	told	her	gently.	At	the	same	time	he	lifted	his	voice.

“Look	out,	Iff—look	out!”

He	 strove	 to	 put	 himself	 between	 the	 girl	 and	 danger,	 making	 a	 shield	 of	 his body.	But	with	a	supple	movement	she	eluded	him.

She	saw	in	the	doorway	of	the	burning	house	the	man	she	had	thought	to	be	her

father.	 The	 other	 man,	 he	 whose	 daughter	 she	 really	 was,	 had	 started	 to	 run toward	the	veranda	steps.	The	man	in	the	doorway	flung	up	his	hand	and,	clear

and	vicious	above	the	crackling	of	the	flames,	she	heard	the	short	song	of	a	Colt

automatic—six	 shots,	 so	 close	 upon	 one	 another	 that	 they	 were	 as	 one

prolonged.

There	 was	 a	 spatter	 of	 bullets	 in	 the	 sandy	 ground	 about	 them;	 and	 then,	 with scarcely	an	appreciable	interval,	a	second	flutter	of	an	automatic.	This	time	the

reports	 came	 from	 the	 pistol	 in	 Iff’s	 hand.	 He	 was	 standing	 in	 full	 glare	 at	 the

bottom	of	the	veranda	steps,	aiming	with	great	composure	and	precision.

The	figure	in	the	doorway	reeled	as	if	struck	by	an	axe,	swung	half-way	round

and	tottered	back	into	the	house.	The	little	man	below	the	veranda	steps	delayed

only	long	enough	to	pluck	out	the	empty	clip	from	the	butt	of	his	pistol	and	slip

another,	loaded,	into	its	place.	Then	with	cat-like	agility	he	sprang	up	the	steps and	 dived	 into	 the	 furnace-like	 interior	 of	 the	 hotel.	 A	 third	 stuttering	 series	 of reports	 saluted	 this	 action,	 and	 then	 there	 was	 a	 short	 pause	 ended	 by	 a	 single shot.

“Come,”	said	Staff.	He	took	her	arm	gently.	“Come	away....”

Shuddering,	she	suffered	him	to	lead	her	a	little	distance	into	the	dunes.	Here	he released	her.

“If	 you	 won’t	 mind	 being	 left	 alone	 a	 few	 minutes,”	 he	 said,	 “I’ll	 go	 back	 and see	what’s	happened.	You’ll	be	perfectly	safe	here,	I	fancy.”

“Please,”	she	said	breathlessly—“do	go.	Yes,	please.”

She	urged	him	with	frantic	gestures....

He	hurried	back	to	the	front	of	the	hotel.	By	now	it	was	burning	like	a	bonfire;

already,	short	as	had	been	the	time	since	the	overturning	of	the	lamp,	the	entire

ground	 floor	 with	 the	 exception	 of	 one	 wing	 was	 a	 roaring	 welter	 of	 flames, while	the	fire	had	leaped	up	the	main	staircase	and	set	its	signals	in	the	windows of	the	upper	story.

Iff	was	standing	at	some	distance	from	the	main	entrance,	having	pushed	his	way

through	 the	 tangle	 of	 undergrowth	 to	 escape	 the	 scorching	 heat	 that	 emanated from	 the	 building.	 He	 caught	 sight	 of	 Staff	 approaching	 and	 waved	 a	 hand	 to him.

“Greetings!”	 he	 cried	 cheerfully,	 raising	 his	 voice	 to	 make	 it	 heard	 above	 the voice	of	the	conflagration.

“Where’s	Nelly?”

Staff	explained.	“But	what	about	Ismay?”	he	demanded.

Iff	grinned	and	hung	his	head	as	if	embarrassed,	rubbing	a	handkerchief	over	the

smoke-stained	fingers	of	his	right	hand.

“I	got	him,”	he	said	simply.

“You	left	him	in	there?”

The	 little	 man	 nodded	 without	 reply	 and	 turned	 alertly	 to	 engage	 Mrs.	 Clover, who	was	bearing	down	upon	them	in	the	first	stages	of	hysterics.	But	at	sight	of

Iff	she	pulled	up	and	calmed	herself	a	trifle.

“Oh,	 sir,”	 she	 cried,	 “I’m	 so	 glad	 you’re	 safe,	 sir!	 I	 was	 asleep	 in	 the	 kitchen when	 the	 fire	 broke	 out—and	 then	 I	 thought	 I	 heard	 pistol	 shots—and	 I	 didn’t know	but	somethin’	had	happened	to	you—”

“No,”	said	Iff	coolly;	“you	can	see	I’m	all	right.”

“And	Eph,	sir?	Where’s	my	husband?”	she	shrieked.

“Oh,”	 said	 Iff,	 at	 length	 identifying	 the	 woman.	 “You’ll	 find	 him	 down	 at	 the dock—dead	drunk	in	the	motor-boat,”	he	told	her.	“If	I	were	you	I’d	go	to	him

right	away.”

“But	whatever	will	we	do	for	a	place	to	sleep	tonight?”

“Help	 yourself,”	 Iff	 replied	 with	 a	 generous	 wave	 of	 his	 hand	 “You’ve	 all Pennymint	 to	 ask	 shelter	 of,	 if	 you	 can	 manage	 to	 make	 your	 husband	 run	 the boat	across.”

“But	you—what’ll	you	do?”

“I’ve	another	boat	handy,”	Iff	explained.	“We’ll	go	in	that.”

“And	will	you	rebuild,	sir?”

“No,”	he	said	gravely,	“I	don’t	think	so.	I	fancy	this	is	the	last	time	I’ll	ever	set foot	on	Wreck	Island.	Now	clear	out,”	he	added	with	a	sharp	change	of	manner,

“and	see	if	you	can’t	sober	that	drunken	fool	up.”

Abashed,	the	woman	cringed	and	turned	away.	Presently	she	broke	into	a	clumsy

run	and	vanished	in	the	direction	of	the	landing-stage.

“You’ve	 accepted	 the	 identity	 of	 Ismay,”	 commented	 Staff	 disapprovingly,	 as they	moved	off	together	to	rejoin	Eleanor.

“For	the	last	time,”	said	the	little	man.	“Until	I	get	aboard	Bascom’s	boat	again, only.	It’s	the	easiest	way.”

“How	do	you	mean?”

The	light	of	the	great	fire	illumined	not	only	all	the	island,	but	the	waters	for

miles	around

Iff	nodded	at	the	blazing	building.	“That	wipes	out	all	scores,”	he	replied.	“What they	find	of	Cousin	Artie	when	that	cools	off	won’t	be	enough	to	hold	an	inquest

over;	he	will	be	simply	thought	to	have	disappeared,	since	I	won’t	return	to	this

place.	And	that’s	the	easiest	way:	we	don’t	got	any	use	for	inquests	at	the	wind-

up	of	this	giddy	dime-novel!”

The	 light	 of	 the	 great	 fire	 illumined	 not	 only	 all	 the	 island	 but	 the	 waters	 for miles	around.	As	Bascom’s	boat	drew	away,	its	owner	called	Staff’s	attention	to

a	 covey	 of	 sails,	 glowing	 pink	 against	 the	 dark	 background	 of	 the	 mainland	 as they	stood	across	the	arm	of	the	Sound	for	the	island.

“Neighbours,”	 said	 Mr.	 Bascom;	 “comin’	 for	 to	 see	 if	 they	 can	 lend	 a	 hand	 or snatch	a	souvenir	or	so,	mebbe.”

Staff	nodded,	with	little	interest.	Out	of	the	corners	of	his	eyes	he	could	see	Iff and	 his	 daughter,	 on	 the	 opposite	 side	 of	 the	 boat.	 Iff	 was	 talking	 to	 her	 in	 a gentle,	 subdued	 voice	 strangely	 unlike	 his	 customary	 acrid	 method	 of

expression.	 He	 had	 an	 arm	 round	 his	 daughter’s	 shoulders;	 her	 head	 rested	 on his....

Staff	looked	away,	back	at	the	shining	island.	He	could	not	grudge	the	little	man

his	hour.	His	own	would	come,	in	time....

If	you	paid	a	fee	for	obtaining	a	copy	of	or	access	to	a	Project

Gutenberg-tm	electronic	work	and	you	do	not	agree	to	be	bound	by	the terms	of	this	agreement,	you	may	obtain	a	refund	from	the	person	or

entity	to	whom	you	paid	the	fee	as	set	forth	in	paragraph	1.E.8.

1.B.		"Project	Gutenberg"	is	a	registered	trademark.		It	may	only	be

used	on	or	associated	in	any	way	with	an	electronic	work	by	people	who

agree	to	be	bound	by	the	terms	of	this	agreement.		There	are	a	few

things	that	you	can	do	with	most	Project	Gutenberg-tm	electronic	works

even	without	complying	with	the	full	terms	of	this	agreement.		See

paragraph	1.C	below.		There	are	a	lot	of	things	you	can	do	with	Project

Gutenberg-tm	electronic	works	if	you	follow	the	terms	of	this	agreement

and	help	preserve	free	future	access	to	Project	Gutenberg-tm	electronic

works.		See	paragraph	1.E	below.

1.C.		The	Project	Gutenberg	Literary	Archive	Foundation	("the	Foundation"

or	PGLAF),	owns	a	compilation	copyright	in	the	collection	of	Project

Gutenberg-tm	electronic	works.		Nearly	all	the	individual	works	in	the

collection	are	in	the	public	domain	in	the	United	States.		If	an

individual	work	is	in	the	public	domain	in	the	United	States	and	you	are

located	in	the	United	States,	we	do	not	claim	a	right	to	prevent	you	from

copying,	distributing,	performing,	displaying	or	creating	derivative

works	based	on	the	work	as	long	as	all	references	to	Project	Gutenberg

are	removed.		Of	course,	we	hope	that	you	will	support	the	Project

Gutenberg-tm	mission	of	promoting	free	access	to	electronic	works	by

freely	sharing	Project	Gutenberg-tm	works	in	compliance	with	the	terms	of

this	agreement	for	keeping	the	Project	Gutenberg-tm	name	associated	with

the	work.		You	can	easily	comply	with	the	terms	of	this	agreement	by

keeping	this	work	in	the	same	format	with	its	attached	full	Project

Gutenberg-tm	License	when	you	share	it	without	charge	with	others.

1.D.		The	copyright	laws	of	the	place	where	you	are	located	also	govern

what	you	can	do	with	this	work.		Copyright	laws	in	most	countries	are	in

a	constant	state	of	change.		If	you	are	outside	the	United	States,	check

the	laws	of	your	country	in	addition	to	the	terms	of	this	agreement

before	downloading,	copying,	displaying,	performing,	distributing	or

creating	derivative	works	based	on	this	work	or	any	other	Project

Gutenberg-tm	work.		The	Foundation	makes	no	representations	concerning

the	copyright	status	of	any	work	in	any	country	outside	the	United

States.

1.E.		Unless	you	have	removed	all	references	to	Project	Gutenberg:

1.E.1.		The	following	sentence,	with	active	links	to,	or	other	immediate

phrase	"Project	Gutenberg"	appears,	or	with	which	the	phrase	"Project Gutenberg"	is	associated)	is	accessed,	displayed,	performed,	viewed,

copied	or	distributed:

This	eBook	is	for	the	use	of	anyone	anywhere	at	no	cost	and	with

almost	no	restrictions	whatsoever.		You	may	copy	it,	give	it	away	or

re-use	it	under	the	terms	of	the	Project	Gutenberg	License	included

posted	with	permission	of	the	copyright	holder),	the	work	can	be	copied

and	distributed	to	anyone	in	the	United	States	without	paying	any	fees

or	charges.		If	you	are	redistributing	or	providing	access	to	a	work

with	the	phrase	"Project	Gutenberg"	associated	with	or	appearing	on	the

work,	you	must	comply	either	with	the	requirements	of	paragraphs	1.E.1

through	1.E.7	or	obtain	permission	for	the	use	of	the	work	and	the

permission	of	the	copyright	holder	found	at	the	beginning	of	this	work.

1.E.4.		Do	not	unlink	or	detach	or	remove	the	full	Project	Gutenberg-tm

License	terms	from	this	work,	or	any	files	containing	a	part	of	this

work	or	any	other	work	associated	with	Project	Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.		Do	not	copy,	display,	perform,	distribute	or	redistribute	this

electronic	work,	or	any	part	of	this	electronic	work,	without

1.E.6.		You	may	convert	to	and	distribute	this	work	in	any	binary,

compressed,	marked	up,	nonproprietary	or	proprietary	form,	including	any

"Plain	Vanilla	ASCII"	or	other	format	used	in	the	official	version

posted	on	the	official	Project	Gutenberg-tm	web	site	(www.gutenberg.net),

you	must,	at	no	additional	cost,	fee	or	expense	to	the	user,	provide	a

copy,	a	means	of	exporting	a	copy,	or	a	means	of	obtaining	a	copy	upon

request,	of	the	work	in	its	original	"Plain	Vanilla	ASCII"	or	other

form.		Any	alternate	format	must	include	the	full	Project	Gutenberg-tm

License	as	specified	in	paragraph	1.E.1.

1.E.7.		Do	not	charge	a	fee	for	access	to,	viewing,	displaying,

performing,	copying	or	distributing	any	Project	Gutenberg-tm	works

unless	you	comply	with	paragraph	1.E.8	or	1.E.9.

1.E.8.		You	may	charge	a	reasonable	fee	for	copies	of	or	providing

access	to	or	distributing	Project	Gutenberg-tm	electronic	works	provided

the	use	of	Project	Gutenberg-tm	works	calculated	using	the	method

you	already	use	to	calculate	your	applicable	taxes.		The	fee	is

owed	to	the	owner	of	the	Project	Gutenberg-tm	trademark,	but	he

has	agreed	to	donate	royalties	under	this	paragraph	to	the

Project	Gutenberg	Literary	Archive	Foundation.		Royalty	payments

must	be	paid	within	60	days	following	each	date	on	which	you

prepare	(or	are	legally	required	to	prepare)	your	periodic	tax

the	Project	Gutenberg	Literary	Archive	Foundation."

you	in	writing	(or	by	e-mail)	within	30	days	of	receipt	that	s/he

does	not	agree	to	the	terms	of	the	full	Project	Gutenberg-tm

License.		You	must	require	such	a	user	to	return	or

and	discontinue	all	use	of	and	all	access	to	other	copies	of

Project	Gutenberg-tm	works.

of	receipt	of	the	work.

-	You	comply	with	all	other	terms	of	this	agreement	for	free

distribution	of	Project	Gutenberg-tm	works.

forth	in	this	agreement,	you	must	obtain	permission	in	writing	from

both	the	Project	Gutenberg	Literary	Archive	Foundation	and	Michael

1.F.

1.F.1.		Project	Gutenberg	volunteers	and	employees	expend	considerable

effort	to	identify,	do	copyright	research	on,	transcribe	and	proofread

public	domain	works	in	creating	the	Project	Gutenberg-tm

collection.		Despite	these	efforts,	Project	Gutenberg-tm	electronic

works,	and	the	medium	on	which	they	may	be	stored,	may	contain

"Defects,"	such	as,	but	not	limited	to,	incomplete,	inaccurate	or

corrupt	data,	transcription	errors,	a	copyright	or	other	intellectual

property	infringement,	a	defective	or	damaged	disk	or	other	medium,	a

computer	virus,	or	computer	codes	that	damage	or	cannot	be	read	by

your	equipment.

1.F.2.		LIMITED	WARRANTY,	DISCLAIMER	OF	DAMAGES	-	Except	for	the	"Right

of	Replacement	or	Refund"	described	in	paragraph	1.F.3,	the	Project

Gutenberg	Literary	Archive	Foundation,	the	owner	of	the	Project

Gutenberg-tm	trademark,	and	any	other	party	distributing	a	Project

liability	to	you	for	damages,	costs	and	expenses,	including	legal

fees.		YOU	AGREE	THAT	YOU	HAVE	NO	REMEDIES	FOR	NEGLIGENCE,	STRICT

LIABILITY,	BREACH	OF	WARRANTY	OR	BREACH	OF	CONTRACT	EXCEPT	THOSE

PROVIDED	IN	PARAGRAPH	F3.		YOU	AGREE	THAT	THE	FOUNDATION,	THE

TRADEMARK	OWNER,	AND	ANY	DISTRIBUTOR	UNDER	THIS	AGREEMENT	WILL	NOT	BE

LIABLE	TO	YOU	FOR	ACTUAL,	DIRECT,	INDIRECT,	CONSEQUENTIAL,	PUNITIVE	OR

INCIDENTAL	DAMAGES	EVEN	IF	YOU	GIVE	NOTICE	OF	THE	POSSIBILITY	OF	SUCH

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.		LIMITED	RIGHT	OF	REPLACEMENT	OR	REFUND	-	If	you	discover	a

defect	in	this	electronic	work	within	90	days	of	receiving	it,	you	can

written	explanation	to	the	person	you	received	the	work	from.		If	you

received	the	work	on	a	physical	medium,	you	must	return	the	medium	with

your	written	explanation.		The	person	or	entity	that	provided	you	with

the	defective	work	may	elect	to	provide	a	replacement	copy	in	lieu	of	a

refund.		If	you	received	the	work	electronically,	the	person	or	entity

providing	it	to	you	may	choose	to	give	you	a	second	opportunity	to

receive	the	work	electronically	in	lieu	of	a	refund.		If	the	second	copy

is	also	defective,	you	may	demand	a	refund	in	writing	without	further

opportunities	to	fix	the	problem.

WARRANTIES	OF	MERCHANTIBILITY	OR	FITNESS	FOR	ANY	PURPOSE.

1.F.5.		Some	states	do	not	allow	disclaimers	of	certain	implied

warranties	or	the	exclusion	or	limitation	of	certain	types	of	damages.

If	any	disclaimer	or	limitation	set	forth	in	this	agreement	violates	the

law	of	the	state	applicable	to	this	agreement,	the	agreement	shall	be

interpreted	to	make	the	maximum	disclaimer	or	limitation	permitted	by

the	applicable	state	law.		The	invalidity	or	unenforceability	of	any

provision	of	this	agreement	shall	not	void	the	remaining	provisions.

1.F.6.		INDEMNITY	-	You	agree	to	indemnify	and	hold	the	Foundation,	the

trademark	owner,	any	agent	or	employee	of	the	Foundation,	anyone

providing	copies	of	Project	Gutenberg-tm	electronic	works	in	accordance

with	this	agreement,	and	any	volunteers	associated	with	the	production,

promotion	and	distribution	of	Project	Gutenberg-tm	electronic	works,

harmless	from	all	liability,	costs	and	expenses,	including	legal	fees,

that	arise	directly	or	indirectly	from	any	of	the	following	which	you	do

or	cause	to	occur:	(a)	distribution	of	this	or	any	Project	Gutenberg-tm

work,	(b)	alteration,	modification,	or	additions	or	deletions	to	any

Project	Gutenberg-tm	work,	and	(c)	any	Defect	you	cause.

Section		2.		Information	about	the	Mission	of	Project	Gutenberg-tm

Project	Gutenberg-tm	is	synonymous	with	the	free	distribution	of

electronic	works	in	formats	readable	by	the	widest	variety	of	computers

including	obsolete,	old,	middle-aged	and	new	computers.		It	exists

because	of	the	efforts	of	hundreds	of	volunteers	and	donations	from

people	in	all	walks	of	life.

Volunteers	and	financial	support	to	provide	volunteers	with	the

assistance	they	need	are	critical	to	reaching	Project	Gutenberg-tm's

goals	and	ensuring	that	the	Project	Gutenberg-tm	collection	will

remain	freely	available	for	generations	to	come.		In	2001,	the	Project

Gutenberg	Literary	Archive	Foundation	was	created	to	provide	a	secure

and	permanent	future	for	Project	Gutenberg-tm	and	future	generations.

To	learn	more	about	the	Project	Gutenberg	Literary	Archive	Foundation

and	how	your	efforts	and	donations	can	help,	see	Sections	3	and	4

and	the	Foundation	web	page	at	http://www.pglaf.org.

Section	3.		Information	about	the	Project	Gutenberg	Literary	Archive

Foundation

The	Project	Gutenberg	Literary	Archive	Foundation	is	a	non	profit

501(c)(3)	educational	corporation	organized	under	the	laws	of	the

state	of	Mississippi	and	granted	tax	exempt	status	by	the	Internal

Revenue	Service.		The	Foundation's	EIN	or	federal	tax	identification

number	is	64-6221541.		Its	501(c)(3)	letter	is	posted	at

The	Foundation's	principal	office	is	located	at	4557	Melan	Dr.	S.

Section	4.		Information	about	Donations	to	the	Project	Gutenberg

Literary	Archive	Foundation

Project	Gutenberg-tm	depends	upon	and	cannot	survive	without	wide

spread	public	support	and	donations	to	carry	out	its	mission	of

increasing	the	number	of	public	domain	and	licensed	works	that	can	be

freely	distributed	in	machine	readable	form	accessible	by	the	widest

array	of	equipment	including	outdated	equipment.		Many	small	donations

($1	to	$5,000)	are	particularly	important	to	maintaining	tax	exempt status	with	the	IRS.

The	Foundation	is	committed	to	complying	with	the	laws	regulating

charities	and	charitable	donations	in	all	50	states	of	the	United

States.		Compliance	requirements	are	not	uniform	and	it	takes	a

considerable	effort,	much	paperwork	and	many	fees	to	meet	and	keep	up

with	these	requirements.		We	do	not	solicit	donations	in	locations

where	we	have	not	received	written	confirmation	of	compliance.		To

SEND	DONATIONS	or	determine	the	status	of	compliance	for	any

particular	state	visit	http://pglaf.org

While	we	cannot	and	do	not	solicit	contributions	from	states	where	we

have	not	met	the	solicitation	requirements,	we	know	of	no	prohibition

against	accepting	unsolicited	donations	from	donors	in	such	states	who

approach	us	with	offers	to	donate.

International	donations	are	gratefully	accepted,	but	we	cannot	make

any	statements	concerning	tax	treatment	of	donations	received	from

outside	the	United	States.		U.S.	laws	alone	swamp	our	small	staff.

Please	check	the	Project	Gutenberg	Web	pages	for	current	donation

methods	and	addresses.		Donations	are	accepted	in	a	number	of	other

ways	including	including	checks,	online	payments	and	credit	card

donations.		To	donate,	please	visit:	http://pglaf.org/donate

Section	5.		General	Information	About	Project	Gutenberg-tm	electronic

works.

Professor	Michael	S.	Hart	is	the	originator	of	the	Project	Gutenberg-tm

concept	of	a	library	of	electronic	works	that	could	be	freely	shared

with	anyone.		For	thirty	years,	he	produced	and	distributed	Project

Gutenberg-tm	eBooks	with	only	a	loose	network	of	volunteer	support.

Project	Gutenberg-tm	eBooks	are	often	created	from	several	printed

editions,	all	of	which	are	confirmed	as	Public	Domain	in	the	U.S.

unless	a	copyright	notice	is	included.		Thus,	we	do	not	necessarily

keep	eBooks	in	compliance	with	any	particular	paper	edition.

Most	people	start	at	our	Web	site	which	has	the	main	PG	search	facility:

http://www.gutenberg.net

This	Web	site	includes	information	about	Project	Gutenberg-tm,

including	how	to	make	donations	to	the	Project	Gutenberg	Literary

Archive	Foundation,	how	to	help	produce	our	new	eBooks,	and	how	to

subscribe	to	our	email	newsletter	to	hear	about	new	eBooks.
